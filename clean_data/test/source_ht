<s id="30076">Another way of viewing this method is that, under each letter of the ciphertext, the entire alphabet is written out in reverse starting at that letter.</s>
<s id="30077">By graphing the frequencies of letters in the ciphertext, and by knowing the expected distribution of those letters in the original language of the plaintext, a human can easily spot the value of the shift by looking at the displacement of particular features of the graph.</s>

<s id="31861">For example, enzymes in a metabolic pathway can be inhibited by downstream products.</s>
<s id="31862">This type of negative feedback slows the production line when products begin to build up and is an important way to maintain homeostasis in a cell.</s>
<s id="31863">Other cellular enzyme inhibitors are proteins that specifically bind to and inhibit an enzyme target.</s>
<s id="31864">Natural enzyme inhibitors can also be poisons and are used as defences against predators or as ways of killing prey.</s>
<s id="31865">In the classic Michaelis-Menten scheme below, an enzyme (E) binds to its substrate (S) to form the enzyme–substrate complex ES.</s>
<s id="31866">The inhibitor (I) can bind to either E or ES with the dissociation constants "K"i or "K"i', respectively.</s>
<s id="31867">The enzyme-inhibitor constant "K"i can be measured directly by various methods; one extremely accurate method is isothermal titration calorimetry, in which the inhibitor is titrated into a solution of enzyme and the heat released or absorbed is measured.</s>
<s id="31868">In these cases, it is usually more practical to treat the tight-binding inhibitor as an irreversible inhibitor (see below); however, it can still be possible to estimate "K"i' kinetically if "K"i is measured independently.</s>
<s id="31869">As this drug resembles the protein that is the substrate of the HIV protease, it competes with this substrate in the enzyme's active site.</s>
<s id="31870">Enzyme inhibitors are often designed to mimic the transition state or intermediate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction.</s>
<s id="31871">An example of such a transition state inhibitor is the antiviral drug oseltamivir; this drug mimics the planar nature of the ring oxonium ion in the reaction of the viral enzyme neuraminidase.</s>
<s id="31872">However, not all inhibitors are based on the structures of substrates.</s>
<s id="31873">For example, the structure of another HIV protease inhibitor tipranavir is shown on the left.</s>
<s id="31874">This molecule is not based on a peptide and has no obvious structural similarity to a protein substrate.</s>
<s id="31875">These non-peptide inhibitors can be more stable than inhibitors containing peptide bonds, because they will not be substrates for peptidases and are less likely to be degraded.</s>
<s id="31876">In drug design it is important to consider the concentrations of substrates to which the target enzymes are exposed.</s>
<s id="31877">For example, some protein kinase inhibitors have chemical structures that are similar to adenosine triphosphate, one of the substrates of these enzymes.</s>
<s id="31878">However, drugs that are simple competitive inhibitors will have to compete with the high concentrations of ATP in the cell.</s>
<s id="31879">Protein kinases can also be inhibited by competition at the binding sites where the kinases interact with their substrate proteins, and most proteins are present inside cells at concentrations much lower than the concentration of ATP.</s>
<s id="31880">As a consequence, if two protein kinase inhibitors both bind in the active site with similar affinity, but only one has to compete with ATP, then the competitive inhibitor at the protein-binding site will inhibit the enzyme more effectively.</s>
<s id="31881">Irreversible inhibitors are generally specific for one class of enzyme and do not inactivate all proteins; they do not function by destroying protein structure but by specifically altering the active site of their target.</s>
<s id="31882">For example, extremes of pH or temperature usually cause denaturation of all protein structure, but this is a non-specific effect.</s>
<s id="31883">Similarly, some non-specific chemical treatments destroy protein structure: for example, heating in concentrated hydrochloric acid will hydrolyse the peptide bonds holding proteins together, releasing free amino acids.</s>
<s id="31884">The rate at which EI* is formed is called the inactivation rate or "k"inact.</s>
<s id="31885">Since formation of EI may compete with ES, binding of irreversible inhibitors can be prevented by competition either with substrate or with a second, reversible inhibitor.</s>
<s id="31886">This protection effect is good evidence of a specific reaction of the irreversible inhibitor with the active site.</s>
<s id="31887">The binding and inactivation steps of this reaction are investigated by incubating the enzyme with inhibitor and assaying the amount of activity remaining over time.</s>
<s id="31888">Fitting these data to a rate equation gives the rate of inactivation at this concentration of inhibitor.</s>
<s id="31889">This is done at several different concentrations of inhibitor.</s>
<s id="31890">Here, accurate measurement of the mass of the unmodified native enzyme and the inactivated enzyme gives the increase in mass caused by reaction with the inhibitor and shows the stoichiometry of the reaction.</s>
<s id="31891">This is usually done using a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer.</s>
<s id="31892">In a complementary technique, peptide mass fingerprinting involves digestion of the native and modified protein with a protease such as trypsin.</s>
<s id="31893">The peptide that changes in mass after reaction with the inhibitor will be the one that contains the site of modification.</s>
<s id="31894">The enzyme hydrolyses the phosphorus–fluorine bond, but the phosphate residue remains bound to the serine in the active site, deactivating it.</s>
<s id="31895">Similarly, DFP also reacts with the active site of acetylcholine esterase in the synapses of neurons, and consequently is a potent neurotoxin, with a lethal dose of less than 100 mg.</s>
<s id="31896">Suicide inhibition is an unusual type of irreversible inhibition where the enzyme converts the inhibitor into a reactive form in its active site.</s>
<s id="31897">This reactive form of DFMO then reacts with either a cysteine or lysine residue in the active site to irreversibly inactivate the enzyme.</s>
<s id="31898">==Discovery and design of inhibitors==New drugs are the products of a long drug development process, the first step of which is often the discovery of a new enzyme inhibitor.</s>
<s id="31899">In the past the only way to discover these new inhibitors was by trial and error: screening huge libraries of compounds against a target enzyme and hoping that some useful leads would emerge.</s>
<s id="31900">This brute force approach is still successful and has even been extended by combinatorial chemistry approaches that quickly produce large numbers of novel compounds and high-throughput screening technology to rapidly screen these huge chemical libraries for useful inhibitors.</s>
<s id="31901">More recently, an alternative approach has been applied: rational drug design uses the three-dimensional structure of an enzyme's active site to predict which molecules might be inhibitors.</s>
<s id="31902">These predictions are then tested and one of these tested compounds may be a novel inhibitor.</s>
<s id="31903">These natural toxins include some of the most poisonous compounds known.</s>
<s id="31904">Since the drug decreases the activity of the enzyme that halts the signal, it makes this signal last for a longer period of time.</s>
<s id="31905">Drugs also are used to inhibit enzymes needed for the survival of pathogens.</s>
<s id="31906">Many metabolic pathways in the cell are inhibited by metabolites that control enzyme activity through allosteric regulation or substrate inhibition.</s>
<s id="31907">A good example is the allosteric regulation of the glycolytic pathway.</s>
<s id="31908">This catabolic pathway consumes glucose and produces ATP, NADH and pyruvate.</s>
<s id="31909">A key step for the regulation of glycolysis is an early reaction in the pathway catalysed by phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK1).</s>
<s id="31910">When ATP levels rise, ATP binds an allosteric site in PFK1 to decrease the rate of the enzyme reaction; glycolysis is inhibited and ATP production falls.</s>
<s id="31911">This negative feedback control helps maintain a steady concentration of ATP in the cell.</s>
<s id="31912">However, metabolic pathways are not just regulated through inhibition since enzyme activation is equally important.</s>
<s id="31913">Many of these are activated by the trypsin protease, so it is important to inhibit the activity of trypsin in the pancreas to prevent the organ from digesting itself.</s>
<s id="31914">One way in which the activity of trypsin is controlled is the production of a specific and potent trypsin inhibitor protein in the pancreas.</s>
<s id="31915">Other examples of physiological enzyme inhibitor proteins include the barstar inhibitor of the bacterial ribonuclease barnase and the inhibitors of protein phosphatases.</s>
<s id="31916">Many natural poisons act as neurotoxins that can cause paralysis leading to death and have functions for defence against predators or in hunting and capturing prey.</s>
<s id="31917">Some of these natural inhibitors, despite their toxic attributes, are valuable for therapeutic uses at lower doses.</s>
<s id="31918">Inhibition of this enzyme causes an uncontrolled increase in the acetylcholine neurotransmitter, muscular paralysis and then death.</s>
<s id="31919">Neurotoxicity can also result from the inhibition of receptors; for example, atropine from deadly nightshade ("Atropa belladonna") that functions as a competitive antagonist of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.</s>
<s id="31920">Although many natural toxins are secondary metabolites, these poisons also include peptides and proteins.</s>
<s id="31921">This toxin can contaminate water supplies after algal blooms and is a known carcinogen that can also cause acute liver hemorrhage and death at higher doses.</s>

<s id="32797">Coal was used to power ever more efficient engines and later to generate electricity.</s>
<s id="32798">Modern sanitation systems and advances in medicine protected large populations from disease.</s>
<s id="32799">The 1973 and 1979 energy crises demonstrated the extent to which the global community had become dependent on non-renewable energy resources.</s>
<s id="32800">The focus ranges from the total carrying capacity (sustainability) of planet Earth to the sustainability of economic sectors, ecosystems, countries, municipalities, neighbourhoods, home gardens, individual lives, individual goods and services, occupations, lifestyles, behaviour patterns and so on.</s>
<s id="32801">The environmental impact of a community or of humankind as a whole depends both on population and impact per person, which in turn depends in complex ways on what resources are being used, whether or not those resources are renewable, and the scale of the human activity relative to the carrying capacity of the ecosystems involved.</s>
<s id="32802">One of the initial attempts to express human impact mathematically was developed in the 1970s and is called the I PAT formula.</s>
<s id="32803">Most of the increase will be in developing countries whose population is projected to rise from 5.6 billion in 2009 to 7.9 billion in 2050.</s>
<s id="32804">This increase will be distributed among the population aged 15–59 (1.2 billion) and 60 or over (1.1 billion) because the number of children under age 15 in developing countries is predicted to decrease.</s>
<s id="32805">In contrast, the population of the more developed regions is expected to undergo only slight increase from 1.23 billion to 1.28 billion, and this would have declined to 1.15 billion but for a projected net migration from developing to developed countries, which is expected to average 2.4 million persons annually from 2009 to 2050.</s>
<s id="32806">It is the combination of population increase in the developing world and unsustainable consumption levels in the developed world that poses a stark challenge to sustainability.</s>
<s id="32807">The Ecological footprint measures human consumption in terms of the biologically productive land needed to provide the resources, and absorb the wastes of the average global citizen.</s>
<s id="32808">In 2008 it required 2.7 global hectares per person, 30% more than the natural biological capacity of 2.1 global hectares (assuming no provision for other organisms).</s>
<s id="32809">The assessment measures 24 ecosystem services concluding that only four have shown improvement over the last 50 years, 15 are in serious decline, and five are in a precarious condition.</s>
<s id="32810">This direct approach is based largely on information gained from earth science, environmental science and conservation biology.</s>
<s id="32811">===Environmental management===At the global scale and in the broadest sense environmental management involves the oceans, freshwater systems, land and atmosphere, but following the sustainability principle of scale it can be equally applied to any ecosystem from a tropical rainforest to a home garden.</s>
<s id="32812">Other human impacts on the atmosphere include the air pollution in cities, the pollutants including toxic chemicals like nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, volatile organic compounds and airborne particulate matter that produce photochemical smog and acid rain, and the chlorofluorocarbons that degrade the ozone layer.</s>
<s id="32813">Of this, 97.5% is the salty water of the oceans and only 2.5% freshwater, most of which is locked up in the Antarctic ice sheet.</s>

<s id="32816">===Management of human consumption===The underlying driver of direct human impacts on the environment is human consumption.</s>
<s id="32817">Analysis of consumption patterns relates resource use to the environmental, social and economic impacts at the scale or context under investigation.</s>
<s id="32818">The ideas of embodied resource use (the total resources needed to produce a product or service), resource intensity, and resource productivity are important tools for understanding the impacts of consumption.</s>
<s id="32819">====Energy====The Sun's energy, stored by plants (primary producers) during photosynthesis, passes through the food chain to other organisms to ultimately power all living processes.</s>
<s id="32820">Since the industrial revolution the concentrated energy of the Sun stored in fossilized plants as fossil fuels has been a major driver of technology which, in turn, has been the source of both economic and political power.</s>
<s id="32821">In 2007 climate scientists of the IPCC concluded that there was at least a 90% probability that atmospheric increase in CO2 was human-induced, mostly as a result of fossil fuel emissions but, to a lesser extent from changes in land use.</s>

<s id="38104">The thoughts may become obsessions which are paralyzing, severe, and constantly present, and can range from thoughts of violence or sex to religious blasphemy.</s>
<s id="38105">These results may be related to underlying cognitive processes involved in OCD.</s>
<s id="38106">However accepting the thoughts can be more difficult for persons with OCD.</s>
<s id="38107">The history of violent crime is dominated by those who feel no guilt or remorse; the very fact that someone is tormented by intrusive thoughts and has never acted on them before is an excellent predictor that they will not act upon the thoughts.</s>
<s id="38108">According to Baer, a patient should be concerned that intrusive thoughts are dangerous if the person does not feel upset by the thoughts, or rather finds them pleasurable; has ever acted on violent or sexual thoughts or urges; hears voices or sees things that others do not see; or feels uncontrollable irresistible anger.</s>
<s id="38109">They can include such thoughts as harming an innocent child; jumping from a bridge, mountain, or the top of a tall building; urges to jump in front of a train or automobile; and urges to push another in front of a train or automobile.</s>
<s id="38110">These thoughts are part of being human, and need not ruin quality of life.</s>
<s id="38111">Like other unwanted intrusive thoughts or images, everyone has some inappropriate sexual thoughts at times, but people with OCD may attach significance to the unwanted sexual thoughts, generating anxiety and distress.</s>
<s id="38112">Their concern over these thoughts may cause them to scrutinize their bodies to determine if the thoughts result in feelings of arousal.</s>
<s id="38113">However, focusing attention of any part of the body can result in feelings in that part of the body, hence doing so may decrease confidence and increase fear about acting on the urges.</s>
<s id="38114">One study suggests that content of intrusive thoughts may vary depending on culture, and that blasphemous thoughts may be more common in men than in women.</s>
<s id="38115">One of these conditions is almost always present in people whose intrusive thoughts reach a clinical level of severity.</s>
<s id="38116">A large study published in 2005 found that aggressive, sexual, and religious obsessions were broadly associated with comorbid anxiety disorders and depression.</s>
<s id="38117">When patients with intrusive thoughts do not respond to treatment, physicians may suspect past physical, emotional, or sexual abuse.</s>
<s id="38118">===Depression===People who are clinically depressed may experience intrusive thoughts more intensely, and view them as evidence that they are worthless or sinful people.</s>
<s id="38119">A study of 85 new parents found that 89% experienced intrusive images, for example, of the baby suffocating, having an accident, being harmed, or being kidnapped.</s>
<s id="38120">Some women may develop symptoms of OCD during pregnancy or the postpartum period.</s>
<s id="38121">Postpartum OCD occurs mainly in women who may already have OCD, perhaps in a mild or undiagnosed form.</s>
<s id="38122">The prevalence of OCD in every culture studied is at least 2% of the population, and the majority of those have obsessions, or bad thoughts, only; this results in a conservative estimate of more than 2 million sufferers in the United States alone (as of 2000).</s>
<s id="38123">A recent study found that 25% of 293 patients with a primary diagnosis of OCD had a history of sexual obsessions.</s>
<s id="38124">Mild cases can also be treated with cognitive behavioral therapy, which helps patients identify and manage the unwanted thoughts.</s>
<s id="38125">This is true of all types of anxiety and fear reactions, not just OCD.</s>
<s id="38126">"Because it is uncomfortable to experience bad thoughts and urges, shame, doubt or fear, the initial reaction is usually to do something to make the feelings diminish.</s>
<s id="38127">By engaging in a ritual or compulsion to diminish the anxiety or bad feeling, the action is strengthened via a process called negative reinforcement—the mind learns that the way to avoid the bad feeling is by engaging in a ritual or compulsions.</s>
<s id="38128">When OCD becomes severe, this leads to more interference in life and continues the frequency and severity of the thoughts the person sought to avoid.</s>
<s id="38129">Cognitive therapy has been shown to be useful in reducing intrusive thoughts, but developing a conceptualization of the obsessions and compulsions with the patient is important.</s>
<s id="38130">Antidepressants which have been shown to be effective in treating OCD include fluvoxamine (trade name Luvox), fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft), paroxetine (Paxil), citalopram (Celexa), and clomipramine (Anafranil).</s>
<s id="38131">Although SSRIs are known to be effective for OCD in general, there have been fewer studies on their effectiveness for intrusive thoughts.</s>
<s id="38132">A study of ten patients with religious or blasphemous obsessions found that most patients responded to treatment with fluoxetine or clomipramine.</s>
<s id="38133">Patients with intense intrusive thoughts that do not respond to SSRIs or other antidepressants may be prescribed typical and atypical neuroleptics including risperidone (trade name Risperdal), ziprasidone (Geodon), haloperidol (Haldol), and pimozide (Orap).</s>
<s id="38134">Studies suggest that therapeutic doses of inositol may be useful in the treatment of obsessive thoughts.</s>
<s id="38135">Carl Jacob Christoph Burckhardt (May 25, 1818 – August 8, 1897) was a historian of art and culture, and an influential figure in the historiography of both these fields.</s>
<s id="38136">He twice declined offers of professorial chairs at German universities, at the University of Tübingen in 1867, and Ranke's chair at the University of Berlin in 1872.</s>
<s id="38137">His innovative approach to historical research stressed the importance of art and its inestimable value as a primary source for the study of history.</s>
<s id="38138">Burckhardt made his first journey to Italy and published his first important article, "Bemerkungen über schweizerische Kathedralen" ("Remarks about Swiss Cathedrals").</s>
<s id="38139">In 1847 he brought out new editions of Kugler's two great works, "Geschichte der Malerei" and "Kunstgeschichte", and in 1853 published his own work, "Die Zeit Constantins des Grossen" ("The Age of Constantine the Great").</s>
<s id="38140">He spent the greater part of the years 1853–1854 in Italy, collecting materials for his 1855 "Der Cicerone: Eine Anleitung zum Genuss der Kunstwerke Italiens" (7th German edition, 1899), also dedicated to Kugler.</s>
<s id="38141">Thus Burckhardt was naturally led to write the two books for which he is best known, his 1860 "Die Kultur der Renaissance in Italien" ("The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy") (English translation, by S. G. C. Middlemore, in 2 vols., London, 1878), and his 1867 "Geschichte der Renaissance in Italien" ("The History of the Renaissance in Italy").</s>
<s id="38142">Burckhardt considered the study of ancient history an intellectual necessity and was a highly respected scholar of Greek civilization.</s>
<s id="38143">At his death, he was working on a four-volume survey of Greek civilization.</s>

<s id="41102">Large receptive fields allow the cell to detect changes over a wider area, but lead to a less precise perception.</s>
<s id="41103">Traditionally, visual receptive fields were portrayed in two dimensions (e.g., as circles, squares, or rectangles), but these are simply slices, cut along the screen on which the researcher presented the stimulus, of the volume of space to which a particular cell will respond.</s>

<s id="41105">Hubel and Wiesel (e.g., Hubel, 1963; Hubel-Wiesel, 1962) advanced the theory that "receptive fields of cells at one level of the visual system are formed from input by cells at a lower level of the visual system.</s>
<s id="41106">" Later theorists elaborated this simple, hierarchical arrangement by allowing cells at one level of the visual system to be influenced by feedback from higher levels.</s>
<s id="41107">For example, light in the centre might increase the firing of a particular ganglion cell, whereas light in the surround would decrease the firing of that cell.</s>
<s id="41108">Photoreceptors that are part of the receptive fields of more than one ganglion cell are able to excite or inhibit postsynaptic neurons because they release the neurotransmitter glutamate at their synapses, which can act to depolarize or to hyperpolarize a cell, depending on whether there is a metabotropic or ionotropic receptor on that cell.</s>
<s id="41109">Receptive fields are similar to those of ganglion cells, with an antagonistic center-surround system and cells that are either on- or off center.</s>
<s id="41110">Hubel and Wiesel (e.g., Hubel, 1963; Hubel-Wiesel 1959) classified receptive fields of cells in the visual cortex into simple cells, complex cells, and hypercomplex cells.</s>

<s id="41266">This is because males have only one copy of the X chromosome, while females have two copies; one normal copy of an X chromosome can compensate for mutations in the other X chromosome, so they are less likely to be symptomatic.</s>
<s id="41267">An XLA patient will pass on the gene, and all of his daughters will be XLA carriers, meaning that any male grandchildren from an XLA patient's daughters have a 50% chance of inheriting XLA.</s>

<s id="41269">==Diagnosis==XLA diagnosis usually begins due to a history of recurrent infections, mostly in the respiratory tract, through childhood.</s>
<s id="41270">The diagnosis is probable when blood tests show the complete lack of circulating B cells (determined by the B cell marker CD19 and/or CD20), as well as low levels of all antibody classes, including IgG, IgA, IgM, IgE and IgD.</s>
<s id="41271">Results of a genetic blood test confirm the diagnosis and will identify the specific Btk mutation, however its cost prohibits its use in routine screening for all pregnancies.</s>

<s id="41279">One of the future prospects of XLA treatment is gene therapy, which could potentially cure XLA.</s>

<s id="43122">The strength of emotions a person feels can stem from his level of dispositional affect.</s>
<s id="43123">===Dimensions===In general, though emotion researchers disagree about the way that emotions and dispositional affect should be classified, a common classification of emotions assumes that each emotion is a combination of pleasantness (pleasant or unpleasant) and activation (high or low)).</s>
<s id="43124">According to this classification, the different combinations of high or low pleasantness and high or low activation create four Quarters.</s>
<s id="43125">The researchers claim that there are two dimensions of dispositional affect: positive affectivity and negative affectivity and that each person has a certain level of both positive affectivity and negative affectivity.</s>

<s id="43132">*Psychological resilience - Individuals who have high levels of positive affectivity have lower levels of the stress hormones (such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, and cortisol), thus physiology gives one explanation in favor of psychological resilience that provides positive resources to confront stressful life events.</s>
<s id="43133">In individualistic cultures, it was found that there is a strong relationship between dispositional affect (either positive or negative) and general life satisfaction (though the relationship was stronger for positive affectivity compared to negative affectivity).</s>
<s id="43134">On the other hand, in many collectivistic cultures, it was found that there is a no relationship between negative affectivity and general life satisfaction, and it may result from the great variance in the ways that different cultures regulate their positive affectivity compared to negative affectivity.</s>
<s id="43135">==Decision making and negotiation==*Decision making - In dealing with interesting and important situations, it was found that individuals who have high levels of positive affectivity make a thorough and efficient cognitive processing, and therefore their decision making process is more efficient, flexible, creative and innovative.</s>

<s id="43155">Unlike some of Richard's other unpopular advisors, John was away from London at the time of the uprising and thus avoided the direct wrath of the rebels.</s>
<s id="43156">On the resumption of war with France in 1369, John was sent to Calais with the Earl of Hereford and a small English army with which he raided into northern France.</s>

<s id="43159">Partly as a result of these failures, and those of other English commanders at this period, John was one of the first important figures in England to conclude that the war with France was unwinnable because of France's greater resources of wealth and manpower.</s>
<s id="43160">This approach led indirectly to the Anglo-French Congress of Bruges in 1374–77, which resulted in a short-lived truce between the two sides.</s>

<s id="43164">By this time, too, some of his possessions were taken from him by the Crown.</s>

<s id="43170">His administration of the province was a disappointment, and his appointment as Duke was much resented by the Gascons, since Aquitaine had previously always been held directly by the King of England or his heir; it was not felt to be a fief that a King could bestow on a subordinate.</s>

<s id="43803">The economic importance of Malaya to Europe grew rapidly during the 18th century.</s>
<s id="43804">Malayan pepper also had a high reputation in Europe, while Kelantan and Pahang had gold mines.</s>
<s id="43805">Various islands were used for this purpose, but the first permanent acquisition was Penang, leased from the Sultan of Kedah in 1786.</s>
<s id="43806">The eastern part of this region (now Sabah) was under the nominal control of the Sultan of Sulu, a vassal of the Spanish Philippines.</s>
<s id="43807">The rest was the territory of the Sultanate of Brunei.</s>
<s id="43808">In 1881, the British North Borneo Company was granted control of the territory of British North Borneo, appointing a governor and legislature.</s>
<s id="43809">The solution was the importation of plantation workers from India, mainly Tamil-speakers from South India.</s>
<s id="43810">The Indians were initially less successful, since unlike the Chinese they came mainly as indentured labourers to work in the rubber plantations, and had few of the economic opportunities that the Chinese had.</s>
<s id="43811">They were also a less united community, since they were divided between Hindus and Muslims and along lines of language and caste.</s>
<s id="43812">Traditional Malay society had great difficulty coping with both the loss of political sovereignty to the British and of economic power to the Chinese.</s>
<s id="43813">A small class of Malay nationalist intellectuals began to emerge during the early 20th century, and there was also a revival of Islam in response to the perceived threat of other imported religions, particularly Christianity.</s>
<s id="43814">Because of the demands of the war in Europe, there was virtually no British air capacity in the Far East.</s>
<s id="43815">Not surprisingly the Chinese, led by the Malayan Communist Party (MCP), became the backbone of the Malayan Peoples' Anti-Japanese Army (MPAJA), which with British assistance became the most effective resistance force in the occupied Asian countries.</s>
<s id="43816">But most Malays were more concerned with defending themselves against the Malayan Communist Party (MCP) which was mostly made up of Chinese, than with demanding independence from the British; indeed, their immediate concern was that the British not leave and abandon the Malays to the armed Communists of the MPAJA, which was the largest armed force in the country.</s>
<s id="43817">The MCP policy was for immediate independence with full equality for all races.</s>
<s id="43818">The Party’s strength was in the Chinese-dominated trade unions, particularly in Singapore, and in the Chinese schools, where the teachers, mostly born in China, saw the Communist Party of China as the leader of China’s national revival.</s>
<s id="43819">Although the MCP succeeded in assassinating the British High Commissioner, Sir Henry Gurney, in October 1951, this turn to terrorist tactics alienated many moderate Chinese from the Party.</s>

<s id="43821">The UMNO-MCA Alliance, which was later joined by the Malayan Indian Congress (MIC), won convincing victories in local and state elections in both Malay and Chinese areas between 1952 and 1955.</s>
<s id="43822">The Emergency left a lasting legacy of bitterness between Malays and Chinese.</s>
<s id="43823">This came on 31 August 1957, when Tunku Abdul Rahman became the first Prime Minister of independent Malaya.</s>
<s id="43824">Between 1959 and 1962 the British government orchestrated complex negotiations between these local leaders and the Malayan government.</s>
<s id="43825">In 1961 Abdul Rahman mooted the idea of forming "Malaysia", which would consist of Brunei, Malaya, North Borneo, Sarawak, and Singapore, all of which had been British colonies.</s>
<s id="43826">The reasoning behind this was that this would allow the central government to control and combat communist activities, especially in Singapore.</s>
<s id="43827">At the time of independence in 1957, the Malays were 55% of the population, the Chinese 35% and the Indians 10%.</s>
<s id="43828">This provoked Tunku Abdul Rahman to demand that Singapore withdraw from Malaysia, which it did in August 1965.</s>
<s id="43829">The two issues were related, since the Chinese advantage in education played a large part in maintaining their control of the economy, which the UMNO leaders were determined to end.</s>
<s id="43830">The MCA leaders were torn between the need to defend their own community’s interests and the need to maintain good relations with UMNO.</s>
<s id="43831">This had the effect of excluding many Chinese students.</s>
<s id="43832">As in education, the UMNO government’s unspoken agenda in the field of economic development was to shift economic power away from the Chinese and towards the Malays.</s>
<s id="43833">Several agencies were set up to enable Malay smallholders to upgrade their production and increase their incomes.</s>
<s id="43834">The Federal Land Development Authority (FELDA) helped many Malays buy farms or upgrade ones they already owned.</s>
<s id="43835">At the same time, an Islamist party, the Islamic Party of Malaysia (PAS) and a Chinese socialist party, the Democratic Action Party (DAP), gained increasing support, at the expense of UMNO and the MCA respectively.</s>
<s id="43836">At the May 1969 federal elections, the UMNO-MCA-MIC Alliance polled only 48% of the vote, although it retained a majority in the legislature.</s>
<s id="43837">Using the Emergency-era Internal Security Act (ISA), the new government suspended Parliament and political parties, imposed press censorship and placed severe restrictions on political activity.</s>
<s id="43838">The Constitution was changed to make illegal any criticism, even in Parliament, of the Malaysian monarchy, the special position of Malays in the country, or the status of Malay as the national language.</s>
<s id="43839">The coalition consisted of UMNO, the MCA, the MIC, Gerakan, PPP, and regional parties in Sabah and Sarawak.</s>
<s id="43840">The government’s response was the New Economic Policy of 1971, which was to be implemented through a series of four five-year plans from 1971 to 1990.</s>
<s id="43841">The plan had two objectives: the elimination of poverty, particularly rural poverty, and the elimination of the identification between race and prosperity.</s>
<s id="43842">Poverty was tackled through an agricultural policy which resettled 250,000 Malays on newly cleared farmland, more investment in rural infrastructure, and the creation of free trade zones in rural areas to create new manufacturing jobs.</s>
<s id="43843">Little was done to improve the living standards of the low-paid workers in plantation agriculture, although this group steadily declined as a proportion of the workforce.</s>
<s id="43844">These years saw rapid growth in Malaysian cities, particularly Kuala Lumpur, which became a magnet for immigration both from rural Malaya and from poorer neighbours such as Indonesia, Bangladesh, Thailand and the Philippines.</s>
<s id="43845">The second arm of government policy, driven mainly by Mahathir first as Education Minister and then as Prime Minister, was the transfer of economic power to the Malays.</s>
<s id="43846">To find jobs for all these new Malay graduates, the government created several agencies for intervention in the economy.</s>
<s id="43847">The Chinese remained disproportionately powerful in Malaysian economic life, but by 2000 the distinction between Chinese and Malay business was fading as many new corporations, particularly in growth sectors such as information technology, were owned and managed by people from both ethnic groups.</s>
<s id="43848">At the 1999 elections Keadilan formed a coalition with the DAP and the PAS known as the Alternative Front (Barisan Alternatif).</s>
<s id="43849">The result of this was that the PAS won a number of Malay seats from UMNO, but many Chinese voters disapproved of this unnatural alliance with the Islamist PAS, causing the DAP to lose many of its seats to the MCA, including that of its veteran leader, Lim Kit Siang.</s>
<s id="43850">The government's objective is for Malaysia to become a fully developed country by 2020 as expressed in "Wawasan 2020".</s>

<s id="45354">John Dunstaple (or Dunstable, c. 1390 – 24 December 1453) was an English composer of polyphonic music of the late medieval era and early Renaissance periods.</s>
<s id="45355">He was one of the most famous composers active in the early 15th century, a near-contemporary of Leonel Power, and was widely influential, not only in England but on the continent, especially in the developing style of the Burgundian School.</s>
<s id="45356">His birth date is a conjecture based on his earliest surviving works (from around 1410–1420) which imply a birth date of around 1390.</s>
<s id="45357">Nothing is known of his musical training and background.</s>
<s id="45358">He was clearly a highly educated man, though there is no record of an association with either Oxford or Cambridge universities.</s>

<s id="45360">Dunstaple is clearly, if indirectly, referred to in some of the verses the abbot composed for each window, not only music but also astronomy, medicine, and astrology.</s>
<s id="45361">He died on Christmas Eve 1453, as recorded in his epitaph, which was in the church of St Stephen Walbrook in London (until it was destroyed in the Great Fire of 1666).</s>
<s id="45362">" A good example of this technique is his "Missa Rex seculorum".</s>
<s id="45363">Dunstaple was probably the most influential English composer of all time, yet he remains an enigma: his complete works were not published until the quincentenary of his death in 1953, but even since then works have been added and subtracted from his "oeuvre"; we know very little of his life and nothing of his undoubted learning; we can only make an educated guess at most of the chronology of the small amount of music that has come down to us; and we understand little of his style – why he wrote as he did, what artistic or technical principles guided his composing, how his music was performed, or why it was so influential.</s>

<s id="45934">Nuclear weapons possess enormous destructive power derived from nuclear fission or combined fission and fusion reactions.</s>
<s id="45935">Physicists on both sides were well aware of the possibility of utilizing nuclear fission as a weapon, but no one was quite sure how it could be done.</s>
<s id="45936">At the time, K-25, one of the Oak Ridge facilities, was the world's largest factory under one roof.</s>
<s id="45937">At the time of the unconditional surrender of Germany on May 8, 1945, the Manhattan Project was still months away from producing a working weapon.</s>
<s id="45938">At the Soviet equivalent of Los Alamos, Arzamas-16, physicist Yuli Khariton led the scientific effort to develop the weapon.</s>
<s id="45939">The news of the first Soviet bomb was announced to the world first by the United States, which had detected the nuclear fallout it generated from its test site in Kazakhstan.</s>
<s id="45940">At the first major theoretical conference on the development of an atomic bomb hosted by J. Robert Oppenheimer at the University of California, Berkeley, participant Edward Teller directed the majority of the discussion towards Enrico Fermi's idea of a "Super" bomb that would use the same reactions that powered the Sun itself.</s>
<s id="45941">It was thought at the time that a fission weapon would be quite simple to develop and that perhaps work on a hydrogen bomb (thermonuclear weapon) would be possible to complete before the end of the Second World War.</s>
<s id="45942">However, in reality the problem of a regular atomic bomb was large enough to preoccupy the scientists for the next few years, much less the more speculative "Super" bomb.</s>
<s id="45943">In the end, President Truman made the final decision, looking for a proper response to the first Soviet atomic bomb test in 1949.</s>
<s id="45944">At this point, however, the exact mechanism was still not known: the classical hydrogen bomb, whereby the "heat" of the fission bomb would be used to ignite the fusion material, seemed highly unworkable.</s>
<s id="45945">Many scientists initially against the weapon, such as Oppenheimer and Bethe, changed their previous opinions, seeing the development as being unstoppable.</s>
<s id="45946">Truman had initially tried to create a media blackout about the test—hoping it would not become an issue in the upcoming presidential election—but on January 7, 1953, Truman announced the development of the hydrogen bomb to the world as hints and speculations of it were already beginning to emerge in the press.</s>
<s id="45947">This created concern within the U.S. government and military, because, unlike Mike, the Soviet device was a deliverable weapon, which the U.S. did not yet have.</s>
<s id="45948">The Castle Bravo incident itself raised a number of questions about the survivability of a nuclear war.</s>
<s id="45949">While technically true, this hid a more gruesome point: the last stage of a multi-staged hydrogen bomb often used the neutrons produced by the fusion reactions to induce fissioning in a jacket of natural uranium, and provided around half of the yield of the device itself.</s>
<s id="45950">This fission stage made fusion weapons considerably more dirty than they were made out to be.</s>
<s id="45951">In this way, the fate of the world was now tied to the fate of the bomb-wielding superpowers.</s>
<s id="45952">The first hydrogen bombs were similarly massive and complicated.</s>
<s id="45953">One was an increase in efficiency and power, and within only a few years fission bombs were developed that were many times more powerful than the ones created during World War II.</s>
<s id="45954">The other was a program of miniaturization, reducing the size of the nuclear weapons.</s>
<s id="45955">Strategic weapons—weapons that could threaten an entire country—relied, for the time being, on long-range bombers that could penetrate deep into enemy territory.</s>
<s id="45956">The policy also encouraged the development of the first early warning systems.</s>

<s id="45958">After stepping so close to the brink, both the U.S. and the USSR worked to reduce their nuclear tensions in the years immediately following.</s>
<s id="45959">The most immediate culmination of this work was the signing of the Partial Test Ban Treaty in 1963, in which the U.S. and USSR agreed to no longer test nuclear weapons in the atmosphere, underwater, or in outer space.</s>
<s id="45960">Because of British involvement in the Manhattan Project, Britain had extensive knowledge in some areas, but not in others.</s>
<s id="45961">France had been heavily involved in nuclear research before World War II through the work of the Joliot-Curies.</s>
<s id="45962">This was discontinued after the war because of the instability of the Fourth Republic and lack of finances.</s>
<s id="45963">However, in the 1950s, France launched a civil nuclear research program, which produced plutonium as a byproduct.</s>
<s id="45964">With the return of Charles de Gaulle to the French presidency in 1958, final decisions to build a bomb were made, which led to a successful test in 1960.</s>
<s id="45965">In 1951, China and the Soviet Union signed an agreement whereby China supplied uranium ore in exchange for technical assistance in producing nuclear weapons.</s>
<s id="45966">In 1953, China established a research program under the guise of civilian nuclear energy.</s>

<s id="47453">==Symbols==According to the Article 53 of the CPC constitution, "the Party emblem and flag are the symbol and sign of the Communist Party of China.</s>
<s id="47454">" At the beginning of its history, the CPC did not have a single official standard for the flag, but instead allowed individual party committees to copy the flag of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.</s>
<s id="47455">On 28 April 1942, the Central Politburo decreed the establishment of a sole official flag.</s>
<s id="47456">"The flag of the CPC has the length-to-width proportion of 3:2 with a hammer and sickle in the upper-left corner, and with no five-pointed star.</s>
<s id="47457">In the center of the upper-left corner (a quarter of the length and width to the border) is a yellow hammer-and-sickle 30 cm in diameter.</s>
<s id="47458">The red color symbolizes revolution; the hammer-and-sickle are tools of workers and peasants, meaning that the Communist Party of China represents the interests of the masses and the people; the yellow color signifies brightness.</s>

<s id="47461">==Ideology==It has been argued in recent years, mainly by foreign commentators, that the CPC does not have an ideology, and that the party organization is pragmatic and interested only in what works.</s>
<s id="47462">This simplistic view is wrong in many ways, since official statements make it very clear the party does have a coherent worldview.</s>
<s id="47463">For instance, Hu Jintao stated in 2012 that the Western world is "threatening to divide us" and that "the international culture of the West is strong while we are weak ... Ideological and cultural fields are our main targets".</s>
<s id="47464">Lastly, Chinese policy-makers believe that one of the reasons for the dissolution of the Soviet Union was its stagnant state ideology.</s>
<s id="47465">"===Formal ideology===Marxism–Leninism was the first official ideology of the Communist Party of China, and is a combination of classical Marxism (the works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels) and Leninism (the thoughts of Vladimir Lenin).</s>
<s id="47466">While the CPC claims that China is in the primary stage of socialism, party theorists argue that the current development stage "looks a lot like capitalism".</s>
<s id="47467">Jiang disagreed, and had concluded that attaining the communist mode of production, as formulated by earlier communists, was more complex than had been realized, and that it was useless to try to force a change in the mode of production, as it had to develop naturally, by following the economic laws of history.</s>
<s id="47468">To apply the Scientific Outlook on Development to Chinese conditions, the CPC must adhere to building a Harmonious Socialist Society.</s>
<s id="47469">===Economics===Deng did not believe that the fundamental difference between the capitalist mode of production and the socialist mode of production was central planning versus free markets.</s>
<s id="47470">He said, "A planned economy is not the definition of socialism, because there is planning under capitalism; the market economy happens under socialism, too.</s>
<s id="47471">Planning and market forces are both ways of controlling economic activity".</s>

<s id="47477">The ruling party which the CPC is most interested in is the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV).</s>
<s id="47478">Chinese analysts on Vietnam believe that the introduction of the Doi Moi reform policy at the 6th CPV National Congress is the key reason for Vietnam's current success.</s>
<s id="47479">While the CPC is probably the organization with most access to North Korea, writing about North Korea is tightly circumscribed.</s>
<s id="47480">The few reports accessible to the general public are those about North Korean economic reforms.</s>
<s id="47481">While Chinese analysts of North Korea tend to speak positively of North Korea in public, in official discussions they show much disdain for North Korea's economic system, the cult of personality which pervades society, the Kim family, the idea of hereditary succession in a socialist state, the security state, the use of scarce resources on the Korean People's Army and the general impoverishment of the North Korean people.</s>
<s id="47482">There are those analysts who compare the current situation of North Korea with that of China during the Cultural Revolution.</s>
<s id="47483">Over the years, the CPC has tried to persuade the Workers' Party of Korea (or WPK, North Korea's ruling party) to introduce economic reforms by showing them key economic infrastructure in China.</s>

<s id="47485">Communication between the CPC and the PCC has increased considerably since the 1990s, hardly a month going by without a diplomatic exchange.</s>

<s id="48055">The boundary between the floating ice shelf and the grounded (resting on bedrock) ice that feeds it is called the grounding line.</s>
<s id="48056">The density contrast between glacial ice, which is denser than normal ice, and liquid water means that only about 1/9 of the floating ice is above the ocean surface.</s>

<s id="48066">Although it is believed that the melting of floating ice shelves will not raise sea levels, technically, there is a small effect because sea water is ~2.6% more dense than fresh water combined with the fact that ice shelves are overwhelmingly "fresh" (having virtually no salinity); this causes the volume of the sea water needed to displace a floating ice shelf to be slightly less than the volume of the fresh water contained in the floating ice.</s>

<s id="52553">The Burgundian School was the first phase of activity of the Franco-Flemish School, the central musical practice of the Renaissance in Europe.</s>
<s id="52554">Most of the musical activity did not take place in what is modern-day Burgundy, which has its capital in Dijon (even though the Dukes of Burgundy maintained an administrative center there).</s>
<s id="52555">The main centers of music-making were Brussels, Bruges, Lille, and Arras, as well as smaller towns in that same general area.</s>
<s id="52556">Charles the Bold was killed in 1477 in the Battle of Nancy, during one of his attempts to add territory to his empire.</s>
<s id="52557">Both the French court and the Habsburgs were patrons of music; however a French style began to diverge from that of the Low Countries, especially in secular music, and in the period after 1500.</s>
<s id="52558">Names associated with this early phase of Burgundian music include Johannes Tapissier and Nicolas Grenon, who carried the tradition across to the next phase of the chapel, when it was reorganized in 1415.</s>
<s id="52559">Of all the names associated with the Burgundian School, the most famous was Guillaume Dufay, who was probably the most famous composer in Europe in the 15th century.</s>
<s id="52560">He wrote music in many of the forms which were current, music which was melodic, singable and memorable (more than half of his sacred music consists of simple harmonizations of plainsong, for example).</s>
<s id="52561">Of the four, the rondeau was by far the most popular; at any rate more rondeaux have survived than any other form.</s>
<s id="52562">Most of the rondeaux were in three voices, and in French, though there are a few in other languages.</s>
<s id="52563">Most of the composers also wrote sacred music in Latin; this was to remain true for the next several generations.</s>
<s id="52564">They wrote both masses and motets, as well as cycles of Magnificats.</s>
<s id="52565">The most prominent of these include:* Canonici Manuscript (containing music from around 1400 to 1440).</s>

<s id="53455">The Archipelago Sea (Finnish "Saaristomeri", Swedish "Skärgårdshavet") is a part of the Baltic Sea between the Gulf of Bothnia, the Gulf of Finland and the Sea of Åland, within Finnish territorial waters.</s>
<s id="53456">The archipelago has a very large number of islands.</s>
<s id="53457">The exact number depends on the definition of the term "island", as the size of the patches of dry land in the area varies from small rocks peeking out of the water to large islands with several villages or even small towns.</s>
<s id="53458">The islands began emerging from the sea shortly after the last ice age.</s>
<s id="53459">The current rate of rebound is between 4 and 10 millimetres a year.</s>

<s id="53491">" The National Police of East Timor (or PNTL) and other civilian security forces are assigned responsibility for internal security.</s>
<s id="53492">In practice the responsibilities of the F-FDTL and PNTL were not clearly delineated, and this led to conflict between the two organisations.</s>
<s id="53493">As what have been designated "new missions", the F-FDTL has been given responsibility for crisis management, supporting the suppression of civil disorder, responding to humanitarian crises and facilitating cooperation between different parts of the government.</s>
<s id="53494">During the period before 1999 some East Timorese leaders, including the current President José Ramos-Horta, proposed that a future East Timorese state would not have a military.</s>
<s id="53495">In mid-2000 the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) invited a team from King's College London to conduct a study of East Timor's security force options.</s>
<s id="53496">The team's report identified three options for an East Timorese military.</s>
<s id="53497">Option 1 was based on FALINTIL's preference for a relatively large and heavily armed military of 3,000–5,000 personnel, option 2 was a force of 1,500 regulars and 1,500 conscripts and option 3 was for a force of 1,500 regulars and 1,500 volunteer reservists.</s>
<s id="53498">The study team recommended option 3 as being best suited to East Timor's security needs and economic situation.</s>
<s id="53499">This recommendation was accepted by UNTAET in September 2000 and formed the basis of East Timor's defence planning.</s>
<s id="53500">The plan was also accepted by all the countries that had contributed peacekeeping forces to East Timor.</s>
<s id="53501">While East Timor's decision to form a military has been criticised by some commentators, the East Timorese government has consistently believed that the force is necessary for political and security reasons.</s>
<s id="53502">While East Timor's political leadership recognises that the country does not currently face an external threat, they believe that it is necessary to maintain a military capacity to deter future aggression.</s>
<s id="53503">The establishment of the F-FDTL was also seen as an effective means of integrating FALINTIL into an independent East Timor.</s>
<s id="53504">=== Formation of the F-FDTL ===FALINTIL officially became F-FDTL on 1 February 2001.</s>
<s id="53505">Most members of the battalion were from East Timor's eastern provinces.</s>
<s id="53506">Due to the force's prestige and relatively high pay, there were 7,000 applications for the first 267 positions in the battalion.</s>
<s id="53507">Some of the problems that have affected the F-FDTL throughout its existence were caused by the process used to establish the force.</s>
<s id="53508">A key flaw in this process was that FALINTIL's high command was allowed to select candidates for the military from members of FALINTIL without external oversight.</s>
<s id="53509">Furthermore, UNTAET failed to establish adequate foundations for the East Timorese security sector by developing legislative and planning documents, administrative support arrangements and mechanisms for the democratic control of the military.</s>
<s id="53510">The F-FDTL gradually assumed responsibility for East Timor's security from the UN peacekeeping force.</s>
<s id="53511">The Lautém District was the first area to pass to the F-FDTL in July 2002.</s>
<s id="53512">After further training the F-FDTL took over responsibility for the entire country's external security on 20 May 2004, although some foreign peacekeepers remained in East Timor until mid-2005.</s>
<s id="53513">The F-FDTL conducted its first operation in January 2003 when an army unit was called in to quell criminal activity caused by west Timorese militia gangs in the Ermera district.</s>
<s id="53514">Tensions between the F-FDTL and PNTL have also reduced the effectiveness of East Timor's security services.</s>
<s id="53515">During 2003 and 2004, members of the police and F-FDTL clashed on a number of occasions, and groups of soldiers attacked police stations in September 2003 and December 2004.</s>
<s id="53516">=== 2006 crisis ===The tensions within the F-FDTL came to a head in 2006.</s>
<s id="53517">In January, 159 soldiers from most units in the F-FDTL complained in a petition to then President Xanana Gusmão that soldiers from the east of the country received better treatment than westerners.</s>
<s id="53518">The 'petitioners' received only a minimal response and left their barracks three weeks later, leaving their weapons behind.</s>
<s id="53519">The crisis escalated into violence in late April.</s>
<s id="53520">Violence broke out on 28 April when some of the petitioners and gangs of youths who had joined the protest attacked the Government Palace.</s>
<s id="53521">After violence spread to other areas of Dili, Prime Minister Mari Alkatiri requested that the F-FDTL help restore order.</s>
<s id="53522">On 3 May Major Alfredo Reinado, the commander of the F-FDTL's military police unit, and most of his soldiers including Lt Gastão Salsinha abandoned their posts in protest at what they saw as the army's deliberate shooting of civilians.</s>
<s id="53523">Fighting broke out between the remnants of the East Timorese security forces and the rebels and gangs in late May.</s>
<s id="53524">A total of 37 people were killed in the fighting in April and May and 155,000 fled their homes.</s>
<s id="53525">In 2004 the commander of the F-FDTL formed a team, which included international contractors, to develop a long-term strategic vision document for the military.</s>
<s id="53526">This study was supported by the Australian Government.</s>

<s id="53528">The repercussions of the 2006 crisis continue to be felt.</s>
<s id="53529">On 11 February 2008, a group of rebels led by Alfredo Reinado attempted to kill or kidnap President Ramos-Horta and Prime Minister Gusmão.</s>
<s id="53530">Although Ramos-Horta and one of his guards were badly wounded, these attacks were not successful and Reinado and another rebel were killed.</s>
<s id="53531">This offer was accepted, and all the petitioners returned to their homes by August that year.</s>
<s id="53532">The F-FDTL is still in the process of rebuilding from the events of 2006.</s>

<s id="53534">The council is chaired by the president and includes the prime minister, the defence, justice, interior and foreign affairs ministers, the heads of the F-FDTL and PNTL a national state security officer and three representatives from the national parliament.</s>
<s id="53535">A parliamentary committee also provides oversight of East Timor's security sector.</s>
<s id="53536">As at early 2010 the Ministry of Defence and Security was organised into elements responsible for defence (including the F-FDTL) and security (including the PNTL), each headed by their own secretary of state.</s>
<s id="53537">At this time the East Timorese Government was working to expand the ministry's capacity with assistance from UNMIT, but continuing shortages of qualified staff limited the extent to which the ministry could provide civilian oversight to the security sector.</s>
<s id="53538">The F-FDTL has an authorised strength of 1,500 regular personnel and 1,500 reservists.</s>
<s id="53539">While all the F-FDTL's personnel were initially FALINTIL veterans the force's composition has changed over time and few soldiers from the insurgency remain due to the force's narrow age requirement.</s>
<s id="53540">After the F-FDTL's 1st Battalion was established in 2001 recruitment was opened to all East Timorese above the age of 18, including women.</s>
<s id="53541">Few women have joined the F-FDTL, however, and as at February 2010 only seven percent of new recruits were female.</s>
<s id="53542">Although the army is small, the guerrilla tactics employed by FALINTIL before the departure in 1999 of the Indonesian Armed Forces were effective against overwhelming numbers and it has the potential to form a credible deterrent against invasion.</s>
<s id="53543">The 2nd Battalion is stationed at the Nicolau Lobato Training Centre near Metinaro.</s>
<s id="53544">Almost all of the 2nd Battalion's soldiers were dismissed during the 2006 crisis.</s>

<s id="54343">"The First Anglo-Dutch War () (1652–54) (called the First Dutch War in England) was the first of the four Anglo-Dutch Wars.</s>
<s id="54344">The process of crystallization of Israeli sculpture was influenced at every stage by international sculpture.</s>
<s id="54345">In the early period of Israeli sculpture, most of its important sculptors were immigrants to the Land of Israel, and their art was a synthesis of the influence of European sculpture with the way in which the national artistic identity developed in the Land of Israel and later in the State of Israel.</s>
<s id="54346">In addition, these techniques facilitated the expression of political and social protest, which up to this time had been downplayed in Israeli sculpture.</s>
<s id="54347">First, both the artists and Jewish society in the Land of Israel were lacking the national Zionist motifs which would accompany the development of Israeli sculpture in the future.</s>
<s id="54348">Second, art history research has failed to find a tradition of sculpture either among the Jewish communities of the Land of Israel or among the Arab or Christian residents of that period.</s>
<s id="54349">At the same time he identified a problem in trying to present a unified picture of that sculpture.</s>
<s id="54350">The reasons were the variety of European influences on Israeli sculpture, and the relatively small number of sculptors in Israel, most of whom had worked for long periods in Europe.</s>
<s id="54351">Even in the "New Bezalel", founded in 1935, Sculpture did not occupy a significant place.</s>
<s id="54352">===Early Land of Israel sculpture===The beginning of sculpture in the Land of Israel, and of Israeli art in general, is usually designated as 1906, the year of the founding of the Bezalel School of Arts and Crafts in Jerusalem by Boris Schatz.</s>
<s id="54353">Even a series of memorial plaques Schatz created for the leaders of the Jewish settlement is derived from Classical art, combined with the descriptive tradition in the spirit of the Ars Novo tradition.</s>
<s id="54354">The influence of Classical and Renaissance art on Schatz can be seen even in the copies of sculptures he ordered for Bezalel, which he displayed in the Bezalel Museum as examples of ideal sculpture for the students in the school.</s>
<s id="54355">Melnikoff created his first work in Israel in 1919, after he arrived in the Land of Israel during his service in the "Jewish Legion".</s>
<s id="54356">In addition, Melnikoff presided over presentations of his works in exhibits of Artists of the Land of Israel in the Tower of David.</s>
<s id="54357">The style is expressed primarily in the anatomical design of the figure.</s>
<s id="54358">Ozeransky's most important work of this period is "Ten Tribes" (1932) - a group of ten square decorative tablets, which describe in symbolic terms the ten cultures associated with the history of the Land of Israel.</s>
<s id="54359">Another work that Ozeranzky was involved in creating during this period was "The Lion" (1935) that stands atop the Generali Building in Jerusalem.</s>
<s id="54360">Although he was never a student at the institution, the work of David Polus was anchored in the Jewish academism which Schatz formulated at Bezalel.</s>
<s id="54361">Polus began to sculpt after he was a stonemason in the labor corps.</s>
<s id="54362">In 1910 the sculptress Chana Orloff emigrated from the Land of Israel to France and began studies in the École Nationale des Arts Décoratifs.</s>
<s id="54363">The artist most closely associated with this movement was the sculptor Itzhak Danziger, who returned to the Land of Israel in 1938 after studying art in England.</s>
<s id="54364">"The dream of Danziger's generation", Amos Keinan wrote after Danziger's death, was "to merge with the Land of Israel and with the land, to create a specific image with recognizable signs, something that is from here and is us, and imprint the stamp of that something special that is us on history.</s>
<s id="54365">In addition to Danziger's pupils, the studio became a gathering place for artists in other fields.</s>
<s id="54366">In this studio Danziger created his first significant works – "Nimrod" (1939) and "Shebaziya" (1939).</s>
<s id="54367">The form of the statue was reminiscent of the primitive art of the Assyrian, Egyptian, and Greek cultures, and similar in spirit to European sculpture of this period.</s>
<s id="54368">Images of idols and figures in the "primitive" style showed up in Israeli art until the 1970s.</s>
<s id="54369">The Israeli sculptors were perceived as a minority not only because of the small number of them in the movement, but primarily because of the dominance of the medium of painting in the view of the leaders of the movement, especially Joseph Zaritsky.</s>
<s id="54370">In spite of the fact that most of the sculptures of members of the group were not "pure" abstract sculpture, they included elements of abstract art and metaphysical symbolism.</s>
<s id="54371">Sternschuss, for example, described the pressure that was put upon members of the group not to include figurative elements in their art.</s>
<s id="54372">Gideon Ophrat, in his essay on the group, found a strong connection between the painting and sculpture of "New Horizons" and the art of the "Caananites.</s>
<s id="54373">This event served as an example of the growing interest of the sculptures in the Israeli landscape, and in particular in the desolate desert landscape.</s>
<s id="54374">Yona Fisher speculated, in his research on art in the 1960s, that the interest of sculptors in the "magic of the desert" arose not just from a romantic yearning for nature, but also from an attempt to inculcate in Israel an environment of "Culture" rather than "Civilization".</s>
<s id="54375">The crystallization of the abstract nature of Dov Feigin's sculpture, was part of a process of an artistic search that was influenced by international sculpture, particularly that of Julio González, Constantin Brâncuși, and Alexander Calder.</s>
<s id="54376">The transition from linear sculpture to planar sculpture, using cut and bent copper or iron, was a process of natural development for Feigin, who was influenced by the works of Pablo Picasso done using a similar technique.</s>
<s id="54377">One of the first of these sculptures was "Dance" (1944), which was displayed in an exhibition next to "Nimrod" in this year.</s>
<s id="54378">To a considerable extent this combination characterized the works of many of the artists of the movement.</s>
<s id="54379">Her sculpture "She Sits" (1953), depicts an unidentified female figure, using lines characteristics of European expressive sculpture, such as the sculpture of Henry Moore.</s>
<s id="54380">===Landscape Sculpture in Conceptual Art===Another aspect of these trends was the growing interest in the boundless Israeli landscape.</s>
<s id="54381">One of the first projects in Israel under the banner of conceptual art was carried out by Joshua Neustein.</s>
<s id="54382">This imaginary river not only created an extraterritorial museum atmosphere, but also hinted in an ironic way at the feeling of messianic redemption after the Six Day War, in the spirit of the Book of Ezekiel (Chapter 47) and the Book of Zechariah (Chapter 14).</s>
<s id="54383">This belief led him to plan projects which combined the rehabilitation of sites with ecology and culture.</s>
<s id="54384">This project was created as a collaboration between Danziger, Zeev Naveh the ecologist, and Joseph Morin the soil researcher.</s>
<s id="54385">" After the first stage of the project, the attempt at rehabilitation was put on display in 1972 in an exhibit at the Israel Museum.</s>
<s id="54386">In 1973 Danziger began to collect material for a book that would document his work.</s>
<s id="54387">Some of the works related not only to coexistence and peace, but also to the larger Israeli political picture.</s>
<s id="54388">In one series of his works Ofek used mirrors to project Hebrew letters, words with religious or cabbalistic significance, and other images onto soil or man-made structures.</s>
<s id="54389">In his work "Letters of Light" (1979), for example, the letters were projected onto people and fabrics and the soil of the Judean Desert.</s>
<s id="54390">At the end of this decade, in works such as "Aqueduct" (1968-1970) or "Segments" (1969), Kadishman combined pieces of glass separating chunks of stone with a tension of form between the different parts of the sculpture.</s>
<s id="54391">With his return to Israel at the beginning of the 1970s, Kadishman began to create works that were clearly in the spirit of "Land Art.</s>
<s id="54392">In the framework of this project Kadishman painted a square in yellow organic paint on the land of the Monastery of the Cross, in the Valley of the Cross at the foot of the Israel Museum .</s>
<s id="54393">"Other Israeli artists also created abstract sculptures charged with symbolism.</s>
<s id="54394">The sculptures of Michael Gross created an abstraction of the Israeli landscape, while those of Yaacov Agam contained a Jewish theological aspect.</s>
<s id="54395">His work was also innovative in its attempt to create kinetic art.</s>
<s id="54396">Works of his such as "18 Degrees" (1971) not only eroded the boundary between the work and the viewer of the work, but also exhorted the viewer to look at the work actively.</s>
<s id="54397">These structures, like the work "Third Watch" (1980), which are presented as defense trenches made of dirt, are also presented as the place which housed the beginning of permanent human existence.</s>
<s id="54398">In sculptures such as "Levitation" (1976) or "Reflection Triangle" (1980), Schwartz dismantled the serious geometry of his sculptures by inserting mirrors that produced the illusion that they were floating in the air, similarly to Kadishman's works in glass.</s>
<s id="54399">In his work "Touching the Border" (January 7, 1974) iron missiles, with Israeli demographic information written on them, were sent to Israel's border.</s>
<s id="54400">Among her important works was "Head Sculpture," in which Natan consulted a sort of wooden sculpture which she wore as a kind of mask on her head.</s>
<s id="54401">In other works, such as "Brushes" (1974–1975), he uses hair from his head and the heads of family members and attaches it to different kinds of brushes, which he exhibits in wooden boxes, as a kind of box of ruins (a reliquary).</s>
<s id="54402">In spite of the clearly political aspects of this work, its complex relationship to the image of the artist in society is also evident.</s>
<s id="54403">The idea that the artistic representation is composed of "simulacra", objects in which the internal relation between the signifier and the signified is not direct, created a feeling that the status of the artistic object in general, and of sculpture in particular, was being undermined.</s>
<s id="54404">The use of this material served to emphasize the way large-scale objects were constructed, often within the tradition of do-it-yourself carpentry.</s>
<s id="54405">" The group of sculptors who called themselves "Drawing Lessons," from the middle of the decade, and other works, such as "Ursa Major (with eclipse)" (1984) and "Jemmain" (1986) created a variety of points of view, disorder, and spatial disorientation, which "demonstrate the subject's loss of stability in the postmodernist world.</s>
<s id="54406">Many of them featured disassembled images of furniture.</s>
<s id="54407">In the beginning of the 1980s expressions of the trauma of the Holocaust began to appear in Israeli society.</s>
<s id="54408">These expressions became more and more explicit in the 1990s.</s>
<s id="54409">In the work "Screens" (1996), which was displayed at the "Documenta" exhibition, Yassour created a map of German trains in 1938 in the form of a table made out of rubber, as part of an experiment to present the memory and describe the relationship between private and public memory.</s>
<s id="54410">These attempts were accompanied by a protest against the image of the Israeli "Sabra" and an emphasis on the feeling of detachment of the immigrants.</s>
<s id="54411">The sculptor Philip Rentzer presented, in a number of works and installations, the image of the immigrant and the refugee in Israel.</s>
<s id="54412">In addition to expressions of the Holocaust, a growing expression of the motifs of Jewish art can be seen in Israeli art of the 1990s.</s>
<s id="54413">In another work, he made a model of a synagogue (1997), with windows in the shape of the letters, Aleph (א) to Zayin (ז) - one to seven - representing the seven days of the creation of the world.</s>
<s id="54414">During the 1990s we also begin to see various representations of Gender and sexual motifs.</s>
<s id="54415">In this way, the structure points out the gap between personal, private space and public space.</s>
<s id="54416">The installation raises questions about the perceptions of memory and personal identity in a variety of ways.</s>
<s id="54417">Other artists sought not only to express in their art homoeroticism and feelings of horror and death, but also to test the social legitimacy of homosexuality and lesbianism in Israel.</s>
<s id="54418">The subject of many of these installations is a critical test of space.</s>
<s id="54419">In the works of Uri Tzaig the use of video to test the activity of the viewer as a critical activity stands out.</s>

<s id="57852">The government accepted these recommendations and the Australian Defence Force was established on 9 February 1976.</s>
<s id="57853">===Defence of Australia era===Until the 1970s, Australia's military strategy centred on the concept of 'forward defence', in which the role of the Australian military was to co-operate with allied forces to counter threats in Australia's region.</s>
<s id="57854">The ADF achieved this by increasing the capabilities of the RAN and RAAF and relocating regular Army units to northern Australia.</s>

<s id="58275">He attended the University of Chicago, both as an undergraduate and as a graduate student, and worked with Harold Lasswell.</s>
<s id="58276">Almond taught at Brooklyn College (now the City University of New York) from 1939 to 1942.</s>
<s id="58277">With U.S. entry into World War II, Almond joined the Office of War Information, analyzing enemy propaganda, and becoming head of its Enemy Information Section.</s>
<s id="58278">After the war, Almond worked for the U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey in post-war Germany.</s>
<s id="58279">==Work==Almond broadened the field of political science in the 1950s by integrating approaches from other social science disciplines, such as sociology, psychology, and anthropology, into his work.</s>
<s id="58280">Almond's research eventually covered many topics, including the politics of developing countries, Communism, and religious fundamentalism.</s>
<s id="58281">Almond was a prolific author, publishing 18 books and numerous journal articles, and co-writing many others.</s>
<s id="58282">It popularized the idea of a political culture - a concept that includes national character and how people choose to govern themselves - as a fundamental aspect of society.</s>
