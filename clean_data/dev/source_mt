<s id="157">In the early nineteenth century, Thomas Young and August Fresnel clearly demonstrated the interference and diffraction of light and by 1850 wave models were generally accepted.</s>
<s id="158">Since the Maxwell theory of light allows for all possible energies of electromagnetic radiation, most physicists assumed initially that the energy quantization resulted from some unknown constraint on the matter that absorbs or emits the radiation.</s>
<s id="159">In 1905, Einstein was the first to propose that energy quantization was a property of electromagnetic radiation itself.</s>
<s id="160">Although he accepted the validity of Maxwell's theory, Einstein pointed out that many anomalous experiments could be explained if the "energy" of a Maxwellian light wave were localized into point-like quanta that move independently of one another, even if the wave itself is spread continuously over space.</s>
<s id="161">This photon momentum was observed experimentally by Arthur Compton, for which he received the Nobel Prize in 1927.</s>
<s id="162">However, experiments confirm that the photon is "not" a short pulse of electromagnetic radiation; it does not spread out as it propagates, nor does it divide when it encounters a beam splitter.</s>
<s id="163">According to our present understanding, the electromagnetic field itself is produced by photons, which in turn result from a local gauge symmetry and the laws of quantum field theory (see the Second quantization and Gauge boson sections below).</s>
<s id="164">In that case, since the wavelength and intensity of light can be varied independently, one could simultaneously determine the position and momentum to arbitrarily high accuracy, violating the uncertainty principle.</s>
<s id="165">Thus, the entire world is quantized; both matter and fields must obey a consistent set of quantum laws, if either one is to be quantized.</s>
<s id="166">For photons, this corresponds to the interference of a Maxwell light wave whereas, for material particles, this corresponds to the interference of the Schrödinger wave equation.</s>
<s id="167">Instead, physicists generally accept the second-quantized theory of photons described below, quantum electrodynamics, in which photons are quantized excitations of electromagnetic modes.</s>

<s id="169">In his model, the rate formula_21 for a system to "absorb" a photon of frequency formula_20 and transition from a lower energy formula_23 to a higher energy formula_24 is proportional to the number formula_25 of atoms with energy formula_23 and to the energy density formula_19 of ambient photons with that frequency,:formula_28where formula_29 is the rate constant for absorption.</s>

<s id="171">This approach gives the correct energy fluctuation formula.</s>

<s id="174">For the electromagnetic field, this gauge symmetry is the Abelian U(1) symmetry of a complex number, which reflects the ability to vary the phase of a complex number without affecting observables or real valued functions made from it, such as the energy or the Lagrangian.</s>
<s id="175">Physicists continue to hypothesize grand unified theories that connect these four gauge bosons with the eight gluon gauge bosons of quantum chromodynamics; however, key predictions of these theories, such as proton decay, have not been observed experimentally.</s>
<s id="176">In a classical wave picture, the slowing can be explained by the light inducing electric polarization in the matter, the polarized matter radiating new light, and the new light interfering with the original light wave to form a delayed wave.</s>
<s id="177">Light of different frequencies may travel through matter at different speeds; this is called dispersion.</s>
<s id="178">In some cases, it can result in extremely slow speeds of light in matter.</s>
<s id="179">The absorption of photons can even break chemical bonds, as in the photodissociation of chlorine; this is the subject of photochemistry.</s>
<s id="180">Individual photons can be detected by several methods.</s>
<s id="181">Other detectors such as Geiger counters use the ability of photons to ionize gas molecules, causing a detectable change in conductivity.</s>
<s id="182">Planck's energy formula formula_70 is often used by engineers and chemists in design, both to compute the change in energy resulting from a photon absorption and to predict the frequency of the light emitted for a given energy transition.</s>

<s id="454">=== Species ===* Cumulonimbus calvus: cloud with puffy top, similar to cumulus congestus which it develops from; under the correct conditions in can become a cumulonimbus capillatus.</s>
<s id="455">Cumulus clouds are often precursors of other types of cloud, such as cumulonimbus, when influenced by weather factors such as instability, moisture, and temperature gradient.</s>
<s id="456">Cumulus clouds are part of the larger category of free-convective cumuliform clouds, which include cumulonimbus clouds.</s>
<s id="457">The latter genus-type is sometimes categorized separately as cumulonimbiform due to its more complex structure that often includes a cirriform or anvil top.</s>
<s id="458">As the air rises, the temperature drops (following the lapse rate), causing the relative humidity (RH) to rise.</s>
<s id="459">At this point a positive feedback ensues: since the RH is above 100%, water vapour condenses, releasing latent heat, warming the air and spurring further convection.</s>
<s id="460">In this phase, water vapor condenses on various nuclei present in the air, forming the cumulus cloud.</s>
<s id="461">The size of the cloud depends on the temperature profile of the atmosphere and the presence of any inversions.</s>
<s id="462">During the convection, surrounding air is entrained (mixed) with the thermal and the total mass of the ascending air increases.</s>
<s id="463">Rain forms in a cumulus cloud via a process involving two non-discrete stages.</s>
<s id="464">The first stage occurs after the droplets coalesce onto the various nuclei.</s>
<s id="465">Due to the extremely small size of the evaporating water droplets, this process becomes largely meaningless after the larger droplets have grown to around 20 to 30 micrometres, and the second stage takes over.</s>
<s id="466">These cloud streets cover vast areas and may be broken or continuous.</s>
<s id="467">They generally form during high-pressure systems, such as after a cold front.</s>
<s id="468">Humid air will generally result in a lower cloud base.</s>
<s id="469">In temperate areas, the base of the cumulus clouds is usually below above ground level, but it can range up to in altitude.</s>
<s id="470">In arid and mountainous areas, the cloud base can be in excess of .</s>
<s id="471">The water droplets form when water vapor condenses on the nuclei, and they may then coalesce into larger and larger droplets.</s>
<s id="472">Although smaller droplets may have been present, the measurements were not sensitive enough to detect them.</s>
<s id="473">The droplet size distribution was slightly bimodal in nature, with peaks at the small and large droplet sizes and a slight trough in the intermediate size range.</s>
<s id="474">Furthermore, large droplet size is roughly inversely proportional to the droplet concentration per unit volume of air.</s>
<s id="475">These clouds form from ground level to at all latitudes.</s>
<s id="476">In the middle étage are the alto clouds, which consist of the limiited-convective cumuliform or stratocumuliform cloud altocumulus and the stratiform cloud altostratus.</s>
<s id="477">The high-étage clouds are all cirriform, one of which, cirrocumulus, is also cumuliform of limited convection or stratocumuliform.</s>
<s id="478">They commonly appear in regular, rippling patterns or in rows of clouds with clear areas between.</s>
<s id="479">The ice crystals in the bottoms of cirrocumulus clouds tend to be in the form of hexagonal cylinders.</s>
<s id="480">These clouds do not last long, and they tend to change into cirrus because as the water vapor continues to deposit on the ice crystals, they eventually begin to fall, destroying the upward convection.</s>
<s id="481">They can have precipitation and are commonly composed of a mixture of ice crystals, supercooled water droplets, and water droplets in temperate latitudes.</s>
<s id="482">However, the liquid water concentration was almost always significantly greater than the concentration of ice crystals, and the maximum concentration of liquid water tended to be at the top of the cloud while the ice concentrated itself at the bottom.</s>

<s id="492">On October 1 he published a result on the number of solutions of polynomials with coefficients in finite fields, which 150 years later led to the Weil conjectures.</s>
<s id="493">In that same year, Italian astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi discovered the dwarf planet Ceres.</s>
<s id="494">Then it disappeared temporarily behind the glare of the Sun.</s>
<s id="495">Several months later, when Ceres should have reappeared, Piazzi could not locate it: the mathematical tools of the time were not able to extrapolate a position from such a scant amount of data—three degrees represent less than 1% of the total orbit.</s>
<s id="496">Gauss, who was 24 at the time, heard about the problem and tackled it.</s>
<s id="497">Gauss's method involved determining a conic section in space, given one focus (the Sun) and the conic's intersection with three given lines (lines of sight from the Earth, which is itself moving on an ellipse, to the planet) and given the time it takes the planet to traverse the arcs determined by these lines (from which the lengths of the arcs can be calculated by Kepler's Second Law).</s>
<s id="498">This problem leads to an equation of the eighth degree, of which one solution, the Earth's orbit, is known.</s>
<s id="499">The solution sought is then separated from the remaining six based on physical conditions.</s>

<s id="2266">From this discussion, the notion of expected value was introduced.</s>
<s id="2267">The work done by Fermat and Pascal into the calculus of probabilities laid important groundwork for Leibniz' formulation of the calculus.</s>
<s id="2268">After a religious experience in 1654, Pascal mostly gave up work in mathematics.</s>
<s id="2269">===Philosophy of mathematics===Pascal's major contribution to the philosophy of mathematics came with his "De l'Esprit géométrique" ("Of the Geometrical Spirit"), originally written as a preface to a geometry textbook for one of the famous ""Petites-Ecoles de Port-Royal" ("Little Schools of Port-Royal")".</s>
<s id="2270">The work was unpublished until over a century after his death.</s>
<s id="2271">Here, Pascal looked into the issue of discovering truths, arguing that the ideal of such a method would be to found all propositions on already established truths.</s>
<s id="2272">At the same time, however, he claimed this was impossible because such established truths would require other truths to back them up—first principles, therefore, cannot be reached.</s>
<s id="2273">Based on this, Pascal argued that the procedure used in geometry was as perfect as possible, with certain principles assumed and other propositions developed from them.</s>
<s id="2274">Nevertheless, there was no way to know the assumed principles to be true.</s>
<s id="2275">Pascal also used "De l'Esprit géométrique" to develop a theory of definition.</s>
<s id="2276">In "De l'Art de persuader" ("On the Art of Persuasion"), Pascal looked deeper into geometry's axiomatic method, specifically the question of how people come to be convinced of the axioms upon which later conclusions are based.</s>
<s id="2277">Pascal agreed with Montaigne that achieving certainty in these axioms and conclusions through human methods is impossible.</s>
<s id="2278">He asserted that these principles can be grasped only through intuition, and that this fact underscored the necessity for submission to God in searching out truths.</s>
<s id="2279">His inventions include the hydraulic press (using hydraulic pressure to multiply force) and the syringe.</s>
<s id="2280">He demonstrated this principle by attaching a thin tube to a barrel full of water and filling the tube with water up to the level of the third floor of a building.</s>
<s id="2281">Having replicated an experiment that involved placing a tube filled with mercury upside down in a bowl of mercury, Pascal questioned what force kept some mercury in the tube and what filled the space above the mercury in the tube.</s>
<s id="2282">At the time, most scientists contended that, rather than a vacuum, some invisible matter was present.</s>
<s id="2283">This was based on the Aristotelian notion that creation was a thing of substance, whether visible or invisible; and that this substance was forever in motion.</s>
<s id="2284">Therefore, to the Aristotelian trained scientists of Pascal's time, a vacuum was an impossibility.</s>
<s id="2285">Rouen was home to two of the finest doctors in France: Monsieur Doctor Deslandes and Monsieur Doctor de La Bouteillerie.</s>
<s id="2286">Pascal was deeply affected and very sad, not because of her choice, but because of his chronic poor health; he too needed her.</s>

<s id="2290">===Brush with death===On 23 November 1654, between 10:30 and 12:30 at night, Pascal had an intense religious vision and immediately recorded the experience in a brief note to himself which began: "Fire.</s>

<s id="2325">;Random-access memory:Random-access memory is used to store both program instructions and data.</s>
<s id="2326">Typically, both need to be present in memory in order for a program to execute.</s>
<s id="2327">Often multiple programs will want access to memory, frequently demanding more memory than the computer has available.</s>
<s id="2328">The kernel is responsible for deciding which memory each process can use, and determining what to do when not enough is available.</s>
<s id="2329">;Input/output (I/O) devices:I/O devices include such peripherals as keyboards, mice, disk drives, printers, network adapters, and display devices.</s>
<s id="2330">Key aspects necessary in resource management are the definition of an execution domain (address space) and the protection mechanism used to mediate the accesses to the resources within a domain.</s>
<s id="2331">Often the first step in doing this is virtual addressing, usually achieved by paging and/or segmentation.</s>
<s id="2332">Virtual addressing allows the kernel to make a given physical address appear to be another address, the virtual address.</s>
<s id="2333">Virtual address spaces may be different for different processes; the memory that one process accesses at a particular (virtual) address may be different memory from what another process accesses at the same address.</s>
<s id="2334">This allows every program to behave as if it is the only one (apart from the kernel) running and thus prevents applications from crashing each other.</s>
<s id="2335">On many systems, a program's virtual address may refer to data which is not currently in memory.</s>
<s id="2336">The layer of indirection provided by virtual addressing allows the operating system to use other data stores, like a hard drive, to store what would otherwise have to remain in main memory (RAM).</s>
<s id="2337">As a result, operating systems can allow programs to use more memory than the system has physically available.</s>
<s id="2338">When a program needs data which is not currently in RAM, the CPU signals to the kernel that this has happened, and the kernel responds by writing the contents of an inactive memory block to disk (if necessary) and replacing it with the data requested by the program.</s>
<s id="2339">The program can then be resumed from the point where it was stopped.</s>
<s id="2340">Virtual addressing also allows creation of virtual partitions of memory in two disjointed areas, one being reserved for the kernel (kernel space) and the other for the applications (user space).</s>
<s id="2341">A device driver is a computer program that enables the operating system to interact with a hardware device.</s>
<s id="2342">It provides the operating system with information of how to control and communicate with a certain piece of hardware.</s>
<s id="2343">The design goal of a driver is abstraction; the function of the driver is to translate the OS-mandated function calls (programming calls) into device-specific calls.</s>
<s id="2344">In theory, the device should work correctly with the suitable driver.</s>
<s id="2345">A kernel must maintain a list of available devices.</s>
<s id="2346">on an embedded system where the kernel will be rewritten if the available hardware changes), configured by the user (typical on older PCs and on systems that are not designed for personal use) or detected by the operating system at run time (normally called plug and play).</s>
<s id="2347">A system call is a mechanism that is used by the application program to request a service from the operating system.</s>
<s id="2348">An example would be from supervisor mode to protected mode.</s>
<s id="2349">This is where the operating system performs actions like accessing hardware devices or the memory management unit.</s>
<s id="2350">Generally the operating system provides a library that sits between the operating system and normal programs.</s>
<s id="2351">Usually it is a C library such as Glibc or Windows API.</s>
<s id="2352">System calls include close, open, read, wait and write.</s>
<s id="2353">===Monolithic kernels===In a monolithic kernel, all OS services run along with the main kernel thread, thus also residing in the same memory area.</s>
<s id="2354">This approach provides rich and powerful hardware access.</s>
<s id="2355">Some developers, such as UNIX developer Ken Thompson, maintain that it is "easier to implement a monolithic kernel" than microkernels.</s>
<s id="2356">Monolithic kernels, which have traditionally been used by Unix-like operating systems, contain all the operating system core functions and the device drivers (small programs that allow the operating system to interact with hardware devices, such as disk drives, video cards and printers).</s>
<s id="2357">This is the traditional design of UNIX systems.</s>
<s id="2358">Every part which is to be accessed by most programs which cannot be put in a library is in the kernel space: Device drivers, Scheduler, Memory handling, File systems, Network stacks.</s>
<s id="2359">Many system calls are provided to applications, to allow them to access all those services.</s>
<s id="2360">A monolithic kernel, while initially loaded with subsystems that may not be needed can be tuned to a point where it is as fast as or faster than the one that was specifically designed for the hardware, although more in a general sense.</s>
<s id="2361">These are interfaces, usually kept in a tabular structure, that access some subsystem within the kernel such as disk operations.</s>
<s id="2362">Essentially calls are made within programs and a checked copy of the request is passed through the system call.</s>
<s id="2363">Hence, not far to travel at all.</s>
<s id="2364">The monolithic Linux kernel can be made extremely small not only because of its ability to dynamically load modules but also because of its ease of customization.</s>
<s id="2365">In fact, there are some versions that are small enough to fit together with a large number of utilities and other programs on asingle floppy disk and still provide a fully functional operating system (one of the most popular of which is muLinux).</s>
<s id="2366">They provide rich and powerful abstractions of the underlying hardware.</s>
<s id="2367">This particular approach defines a high-level virtual interface over the hardware, with a set of system calls to implement operating system services such as process management, concurrency and memory management in several modules that run in supervisor mode.</s>
<s id="2368">Rebooting the computer is often required.</s>
<s id="2369">This is not just a problem of convenience to the developers.</s>
<s id="2370">* Since the modules run in the same address space, a bug can bring down the entire system.</s>
<s id="2371">A microkernel that is designed for a specific platform or device is only ever going to have what it needs to operate.</s>
<s id="2372">The microkernel approach consists of defining a simple abstraction over the hardware, with a set of primitives or system calls to implement minimal OS services such as memory management, multitasking, and inter-process communication.</s>
<s id="2373">Other services, including those normally provided by the kernel, such as networking, are implemented in user-space programs, referred to as "servers".</s>
<s id="2374">Microkernels are easier to maintain than monolithic kernels, but the large number of system calls and context switches might slow down the system because they typically generate more overhead than plain function calls.</s>
<s id="2375">Only parts which really require being in a privileged mode are in kernel space: IPC (Inter-Process Communication), Basic scheduler, or scheduling primitives, Basic memory handling, Basic I/O primitives.</s>
<s id="2376">Many critical parts are now running in user space: The complete scheduler, Memory handling,File systems, and Network stacks.</s>
<s id="2377">In the microkernel, only the most fundamental of tasks are performed such as being able to access some (not necessarily all) of the hardware, manage memory and coordinate message passing between the processes.</s>
<s id="2378">Servers allow the operating system to be modified by simply starting and stopping programs.</s>
<s id="2379">* Process management in general can be very complicated.</s>

<s id="5109">The first record of the legend dates from more than 300 years after the campaign, and the first record connects the legend to a much smaller battle, though still in Estonia; the battle of Fellin (Viljandi) in 1208.</s>
<s id="5110">This story originates from two written sources from the early 16th century.</s>
<s id="5111">He also mentions that this flag, falling from the sky during the Russian campaign of King Valdemar II, is the very same flag that King Eric of Pomerania took with him when he left the country in 1440 after being deposed as King.</s>
<s id="5112">The second source is the writing of the Franciscan monk Petrus Olai (Peder Olsen) of Roskilde, from 1527.</s>
<s id="5113">===Continuation of the romantic legend===According to tradition, the original flag from the Battle of Lyndanisse was used in the small campaign of 1500 when King Hans tried to conquer Dithmarschen (in western Holstein in north Germany).</s>
<s id="5114">Both claim that this was the original flag, and consequently both writers knew the legend of the falling flag.</s>
<s id="5115">He notes that the flag was in a poor condition when returned.</s>
<s id="5116">In a letter dated 22 February 1500 to Oluf Stigsøn, King John describes the battle, but does not mention the loss of an important flag.</s>
<s id="5117">It was saved only by the combined efforts of the banner-carrier Mogens Gyldenstierne, taking multiple wounds, and a young man coming to his rescue.</s>
<s id="5118">This is however not the end of the story.</s>
<s id="5119">A priest and historian from Dithmarschen, Neocorus, wrote in 1598 that the banner captured in 1500, was brought to the church in Wöhrden and hung there for the next 59 years, until it was returned to the Danes as part of the peace settlement in 1559.</s>
<s id="5120">Historically, it is of course impossible to prove or disprove that these records speak of the same flag, or if the flag of 1208 or 1219 ever existed.</s>
<s id="5121">Moreover, it is unlikely that the pope would send such a banner, given the fact that they already had one, namely the banner of the Knights Hospitaller (Danish: "Johanitterne").</s>
<s id="5122">===Adolf Ditlev Jørgensen===A theory brought forth by the Danish historian Adolf Ditlev Jørgensen in 1875 in his book ""Danebroges Oprindelse"" is that the Danish flag "is" the banner of the Knights Hospitaller.</s>
<s id="5123">He notes that the order came to Denmark in the latter half of the 12th century and during the next centuries spread to major cities, like Odense, Viborg, Horsens, Ribe and their headquarters in Slagelse, so by the time of the Baltic crusade, the symbol was already a known symbol in Denmark.</s>
<s id="5124">He claims that the origin of the legend of the falling flag comes from this confusion in the battle.</s>
<s id="5125">All these theories centre on two battles in Estonia, Fellin (1208) or Lyndanisse (1219), and thus try to explain the origin in relation to the tale brought forth over 300 years after the event.</s>
<s id="5126">She claims that it is neither the battle nor the banner that is central to the tale, but rather the cross in the sky.</s>
<s id="5127">Similar tales of appearances in the sky at critical moments, particularly of crosses, can be found all over Europe.</s>
<s id="5128">Bruhn mentions a battle (also mentioned by "Fabricius") taking place on September 10, 1217 between Christian knights and Moor warriors on the Iberian Peninsula near the castle Alcazar, where it is said that a golden cross on white appeared in the sky, to bring victory to the Christians.</s>
<s id="5129">The English flag, the Saint George's Cross is also claimed to have appeared in the sky during a critical battle, in this case in Jerusalem during the crusades.</s>
<s id="5130">The symbol later became the coat-of-arms of the city.</s>
<s id="5131">===Gelre armorial===The earliest source that indisputably links the red flag with a white cross to a Danish King, and to the realm itself, is found in a Dutch armorial, the "Gelre Armorial" (Dutch: "Wapenboek Gelre"), written between 1340 and 1370 (some sources say 1378 or 1386).</s>

<s id="7527">In his spare time, he set up a photography laboratory with two friends and found business from a local photography company.</s>
<s id="7528">In 1922, Pauling graduated from Oregon State University (known then as Oregon Agricultural College) with a degree in chemical engineering and went on to graduate school at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena, California, under the guidance of Roscoe Dickinson and Richard Tolman.</s>
<s id="7529">He published seven papers on the crystal structure of minerals while he was at Caltech.</s>
<s id="7530">He later traveled to Europe on a Guggenheim Fellowship, which was awarded to him in 1926, to study under German physicist Arnold Sommerfeld in Munich, Danish physicist Niels Bohr in Copenhagen and Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger in Zürich.</s>
<s id="7531">All three were experts in the new field of quantum mechanics and other branches of physics.</s>
<s id="7532">Pauling became interested in how quantum mechanics might be applied in his chosen field of interest, the electronic structure of atoms and molecules.</s>
<s id="7533">In Zürich, Pauling was also exposed to one of the first quantum mechanical analyses of bonding in the hydrogen molecule, done by Walter Heitler and Fritz London.</s>

<s id="7544">In 1946, he joined the Emergency Committee of Atomic Scientists, chaired by Albert Einstein.</s>
<s id="7545">Its mission was to warn the public of the dangers associated with the development of nuclear weapons.</s>
<s id="7546">His political activism prompted the U.S. State Department to deny him a passport in 1952, when he was invited to speak at a scientific conference in London.</s>
<s id="7547">His passport was restored in 1954, shortly before the ceremony in Stockholm where he received his first Nobel Prize.</s>
<s id="7548">Joining Einstein, Bertrand Russell and eight other leading scientists and intellectuals, he signed the Russell-Einstein Manifesto in 1955.</s>
<s id="7549">In 1958, Pauling joined a petition drive in cooperation with the founders of the St. Louis Citizen's Committee for Nuclear Information (CNI).</s>
<s id="7550">On the day that the treaty went into force, the Nobel Prize Committee awarded Pauling the Nobel Peace Prize, describing him as "Linus Carl Pauling, who ever since 1946 has campaigned ceaselessly, not only against nuclear weapons tests, not only against the spread of these armaments, not only against their very use, but against all warfare as a means of solving international conflicts.</s>
<s id="7551">The Caltech Chemistry Department, wary of his political views, did not even formally congratulate him.</s>

<s id="7558">After becoming convinced of its worth, Pauling took 3 grams of vitamin C every day to prevent colds.</s>
<s id="7559">He began a long clinical collaboration with the British cancer surgeon Ewan Cameron in 1971 on the use of intravenous and oral vitamin C as cancer therapy for terminal patients.</s>
<s id="7560">Cameron and Pauling wrote many technical papers and a popular book, "Cancer and Vitamin C", that discussed their observations.</s>
<s id="7561">Pauling made vitamin C popular with the public and eventually published two studies of a group of 100 allegedly terminal patients that claimed vitamin C increased survival by as much as four times compared to untreated patients.</s>
<s id="7562">Later clinical trials conducted by the Mayo Clinic also concluded that high-dose (10,000 mg) vitamin C was no better than placebo at treating cancer and that there was no benefit to high-dose vitamin C. The failure of the clinical trials to demonstrate any benefit resulted in the conclusion that vitamin C was not effective in treating cancer; the medical establishment concluding that his claims that vitamin C could prevent colds or treat cancer were quackery.</s>
<s id="7563">Pauling also criticised the Mayo clinic studies because the controls were taking vitamin C during the trial, and because the duration of the treatment with vitamin C was short; Pauling advocated continued high dose vitamin C for the rest of the cancer patient's life whereas the Mayo clinic patients in the second trial were treated with vitamin C for a median of 2.5 months.</s>
<s id="7564">The results were publicly debated at length with considerable acrimony between Pauling and Cameron, and Moertel (the lead author of the Mayo Clinic studies), with accusations of misconduct and scientific incompetence on both sides.</s>
<s id="7565">Ultimately the negative findings of the Mayo Clinic studies ended general interest in vitamin C as a treatment for cancer.</s>

<s id="12330">===Restoring royal authority===With the end of the civil war, Henry's government faced the task of rebuilding royal authority across large parts of the country.</s>
<s id="12331">In part, this was because William was unable to offer significant patronage, despite the expectations from the loyalist barons that they would be rewarded.</s>

<s id="12333">The government issued the Charter of the Forest, which attempted to reform the royal governance of the forests.</s>

<s id="12335">The fate of Henry's family lands in France still remained uncertain.</s>
<s id="12336">The French kings, however, had an increasing financial, and thus military, advantage over Henry.</s>
<s id="12337">Henry was unable to gain a clear military advantage and became concerned that Louis of France might seize the opportunity to invade Brittany – where the truce was about to expire – while he was distracted at home.</s>
<s id="12338">Henry agreed to make peace, but, before the negotiations were completed, Richard died of wounds suffered in battle, leaving his younger brother Gilbert to inherit his lands.</s>
<s id="12339">Henry could only send a small force of soldiers to assist, and Brittany fell to Louis in November.</s>
<s id="12340">For the next 24 years, Henry ruled the kingdom personally, rather than through senior ministers.</s>
<s id="12341">Henry wanted to use his court to unite his English and continental subjects, and it included Simon de Montfort, originally a French knight who had married Henry's sister Eleanor and become the Earl of Leicester, in addition to the later influxes of Henry's Savoyard and Lusignan relatives.</s>
<s id="12342">He spent more time in Westminster than any of his predecessors, shaping the formation of England's capital city.</s>

<s id="12347">===Jewish policies===The Jews of England were considered the property of the Crown, and they had traditionally been used as a source of cheap loans and easy taxation, in exchange for royal protection against antisemitism.</s>
<s id="12348">The Jews had suffered considerable oppression during the First Barons' War, but during Henry's early years the community had flourished and became one of the most prosperous in Europe.</s>
<s id="12349">This was driven by financial self-interest, as they stood to profit considerably from a strong Jewish community in England.</s>
<s id="12350">Henry had built the "Domus Conversorum" in London in 1232 to help convert Jews to Christianity, and efforts intensified after 1239; as many as 10 percent of the Jews in England had been converted by the late 1250s.</s>
<s id="12351">Eleanor was well-mannered, cultured and articulate, but the primary reason for the marriage was political, as Henry stood to create a valuable set of alliances with the rulers of the south and south-east of France.</s>
<s id="12352">The marriage contract was confirmed in 1235 and Eleanor travelled to England to meet Henry for the first time.</s>
<s id="12353">A third daughter, Katherine, was born in 1253 but soon fell ill, possibly the result of a degenerative disorder such as Rett syndrome, and was unable to speak.</s>
<s id="12354">The rebels had counted on aid from Henry, but he lacked domestic support and was slow to mobilise an army, not arriving in France until the next summer.</s>
<s id="12355">In the aftermath of the revolt, French power extended throughout Poitou, threatening the interests of the Lusignan family.</s>
<s id="12356">Henry encouraged some to help him on the continent; others acted as mercenaries and diplomatic agents, or fought on Henry's behalf in European campaigns.</s>
<s id="12357">For Henry, the community was an important symbol of his hopes to one day reconquer Poitou and the rest of his French lands, and many of the Lusignans became close friends with his son Edward.</s>
<s id="12358">The presence of Henry's extended family in England proved controversial.</s>
<s id="12359">Ireland was important to Henry, both as a source of royal revenue – an average of £1,150 was sent from Ireland to the Crown each year during the middle of his reign – and as a source of estates that could be granted to his supporters.</s>
<s id="12360">In 1254, Henry granted Ireland to his son, Edward, on condition that it would never be separated from the Crown.</s>
<s id="12361">Henry maintained peace with Scotland during his reign, where he was the feudal lord of Alexander II.</s>
<s id="12362">Alexander married Henry's sister Joan in 1221, and after he and Henry signed the Treaty of York in 1237, Henry had a secure northern frontier.</s>
<s id="12363">Henry knighted Alexander III before the young King married Henry's daughter Margaret in 1251 and, despite Alexander's refusal to give homage to Henry for Scotland, the two enjoyed a good relationship.</s>
<s id="12364">In the process, Henry's attention became increasingly focused on European politics and events rather than domestic affairs.</s>
<s id="12365">Henry and Eleanor quarrelled over the issue and were not reconciled until the following year.</s>
<s id="12366">On the way back from Gascony, Henry met with Louis for the first time in an arrangement brokered by their wives, and the two kings became close friends.</s>
<s id="12367">With minimal consultation within his court, Henry came to an agreement with the Pope in 1254 that Edmund should be the next king.</s>
<s id="12368">Parliament again refused to assist the King in raising this money.</s>
<s id="12369">One of the priorities for the new regime, however, was to settle the long-running dispute with France and, at the end of 1259, Henry and Eleanor left for Paris to negotiate the final details of a peace treaty with King Louis, escorted by Simon de Montfort and much of the baronial government.</s>
<s id="12370">Henry finally returned to retake power in England in April 1260, where conflict was brewing between de Clare's forces and those of de Montfort and Edward.</s>
<s id="12371">Henry continued to publicly support the Provisions of Oxford, but he secretly opened discussions with Pope Urban IV, hoping to be absolved from the oath he had made at Oxford.</s>
<s id="12372">Henry and Eleanor mobilised their own supporters and raised a foreign mercenary army.</s>
<s id="12373">He attempted to settle the crisis permanently by forcing the barons to agree to the Treaty of Kingston.</s>
<s id="12374">Henry softened some of his policies in response to the concerns of the barons, but he soon began to target his political enemies and recommence his unpopular Sicilian policy.</s>
<s id="12375">De Montfort's coalition began to quickly fragment, Henry regained his freedom of movement and renewed chaos spread across England.</s>
<s id="12376">Initially de Montfort's legal arguments held sway, but in January 1264, Louis announced the Mise of Amiens, condemning the rebels, upholding the King's rights and annulling the Provisions of Oxford.</s>
<s id="12377">Louis had strong views of his own on the rights of kings over those of barons, but was also influenced by his wife, Margaret, who was Eleanor's sister, and by the Pope.</s>
<s id="12378">Becoming desperate, de Montfort marched in pursuit of Henry and the two armies met at the Battle of Lewes on 14 May.</s>
<s id="12379">In France, Eleanor made plans for an invasion of England with the support of Louis, while Edward escaped his captors in May and formed a new army.</s>
<s id="12380">De Montfort, accompanied by the captive Henry, was unable to retreat and the Battle of Evesham ensued.</s>
<s id="12381">He was succeeded by Edward, who slowly made his way back to England via Gascony, finally arriving in August 1274.</s>

<s id="12384">These measures, however, produced few results; the only major military victory in this phase of the war was the English naval victory at Sluys on 24 June 1340, which secured English control of the Channel.</s>
<s id="12385">The extraordinary circumstances of the April parliament had forced the king into submission, but under normal circumstances the powers of the king in medieval England were virtually unlimited, a fact that Edward was able to exploit.</s>

<s id="12408">The first major challenge of the reign was the Peasants' Revolt in 1381.</s>
<s id="12409">In the following years, however, the king's dependence on a small number of courtiers caused discontent among the influential, and in 1387 control of government was taken over by a group of aristocrats known as the Lords Appellant.</s>

<s id="12428">In particular, the execution of his former teacher Sir Simon de Burley was an insult not easily forgotten.</s>
<s id="12429">However, the plan failed because it included a requirement that the English king pay homage to the King of Francea condition that proved unacceptable to the English public.</s>

<s id="14241">==Causes==Economists offer two principal explanations for why stagflation occurs.</s>
<s id="14242">While monetary and fiscal policy can be used to stabilise the economy in the face of aggregate demand fluctuations, they are not very useful in confronting aggregate supply fluctuations.</s>
<s id="14243">The second major shock was the 1973 oil crisis, when the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) constrained the worldwide supply of oil.</s>
<s id="14244">For example, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the scarcity of oil was relieved by increases in both energy efficiency and global oil production.</s>
<s id="14245">This factor, along with adjustments in monetary policies, helped end stagflation.</s>
<s id="14246">Neoclassical macroeconomists argue that real economic quantities, like real output, employment, and unemployment, are determined by real factors only.</s>
<s id="14247">Thus the main explanation for stagflation under a classical view of the economy is simply policy errors that affect both inflation and the labour market.</s>
<s id="14248">There is no subtler, no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency.</s>
<s id="14249">The process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction, and does it in a manner which not one man in a million is able to diagnose.</s>
<s id="14250">This is without allowing anything for the payment of the indemnity.</s>
<s id="14251">In Russia, Poland, Hungary, or Austria such a thing as a budget cannot be seriously considered to exist at all.</s>
<s id="14252">Therefore, while mainstream economists today might often attribute short periods of stagflation (not more than a few years) to adverse changes in supply, they would not accept this as an explanation of very prolonged stagflation.</s>
<s id="14253">With increasing mergers and acquisitions, the power to implement stagflation increases.</s>
<s id="14254">Dominant firms are able to increase their own prices at a faster rate than competitors.</s>

<s id="14665">==History=====Origins===Romanesque architecture was the first distinctive style to spread across Europe since the Roman Empire.</s>
<s id="14666">Architecture of a Romanesque style also developed simultaneously in the north of Italy, parts of France and in the Iberian Peninsula in the 10th century and prior to the later influence of the Abbey of Cluny.</s>
<s id="14667">The style, sometimes called First Romanesque or Lombard Romanesque, is characterised by thick walls, lack of sculpture and the presence of rhythmic ornamental arches known as a Lombard band.</s>
<s id="14668">The domed churches of Constantinople and Eastern Europe were to greatly affect the architecture of certain towns, particularly through trade and through the Crusades.</s>
<s id="14669">The result of this was that they could be called upon, not only for local and regional spats, but to follow their lord to travel across Europe to the Crusades, if they were required to do so.</s>
<s id="14670">In Spain, the most famous church of the period is Santiago de Compostela.</s>

<s id="14674">Some buildings, like Santa Maria in Cosmedin (illustrated above) and the atrium at San Clemente in Rome, may have an odd assortment of columns in which large capitals are placed on short columns and small capitals are placed on taller columns to even the height.</s>
<s id="14675">====Drum columns====In most parts of Europe, Romanesque columns were massive, as they supported thick upper walls with small windows, and sometimes heavy vaults.</s>
<s id="14676">The most common method of construction was to build them out of stone cylinders called drums, as in the crypt at Speyer Cathedral.</s>
<s id="14677">The Corinthian capital is essentially round at the bottom where it sits on a circular column and square at the top, where it supports the wall or arch.</s>
<s id="14678">This shape lent itself to a wide variety of superficial treatments, sometimes foliate in imitation of the source, but often figurative.</s>
<s id="14679">In parts of France and Italy there are strong links to the pierced capitals of Byzantine architecture.</s>

<s id="14734">===1994–2000: The Grant Hill era===The team's fortunes improved after that season, but the rebuilding process soon sputtered.</s>
<s id="14735">Of those coaches, only Collins had any sort of success with the Pistons, winning 54 games in the 1996–97 season.</s>

<s id="14749">In 1983–84, the Pacers finished with the worst record in the Eastern Conference, which would have given the Pacers the second overall pick in the draft—the pick that the Blazers used to select Sam Bowie while Michael Jordan was still available.</s>
<s id="14750">===1987–2005: The Reggie Miller era ===Reggie Miller was drafted by the Pacers in 1987, beginning his career as a backup to John Long.</s>

<s id="14766">The Bucks remained a powerhouse for the first half of the 1970s.</s>

<s id="14773">From 1991 through 1998, the Bucks suffered seven straight seasons of losing records.</s>
<s id="14774">During this period, the Bucks drafted Glenn Robinson with the first overall pick in the 1994 NBA Draft and in 1996 acquired rookie Ray Allen in a draft day trade with the Minnesota Timberwolves.</s>
<s id="14775">The nucleus of the "big three"—consisting of Ray Allen, Cassell, and Robinson—along with Karl, created a successful renaissance era in Milwaukee.</s>
<s id="14776">Behind the strong encouragement of George Karl, the Bucks acquired forward Anthony Mason at the beginning of the 2001–02 season.</s>

<s id="14800">===2004–2012: The Dwight Howard era===In the off-season, Weisbrod completely dismantled the team.</s>
<s id="14801">The most significant trade was Tracy McGrady.</s>
<s id="14802">McGrady, discontent with the Magic, wished to move on; Weisbrod accused McGrady of "slacking off" and not attending practices (McGrady later admitted that he did not give 100% percent during the 2003–2004 season and wanted the team to bring him some help, but never wanted to leave Orlando).</s>
<s id="14803">Howard was a consistent rebounder and scorer, becoming the first rookie to start and play all 82 games in a season.</s>
<s id="14804">Hill also returned and averaged 19.7 points a game.</s>

<s id="14806">After playing in three preseason games, he underwent surgery to correct the hernia and would not appear during the regular season until mid-December, to which he lasted a month before attempting to make another comeback in February and early March, however he only played sporadically.</s>
<s id="14807">The streak included wins against NBA powerhouses Detroit, San Antonio, Dallas and Miami, as well as a game against the Philadelphia 76ers in which Howard recorded 28 points and a career-high 26 rebounds.</s>
<s id="14808">The next day, Donovan wished to be released from the contract and the Magic agreed several days later.</s>
<s id="14809">At the start of March, the Magic seemed to pick up speed again, finishing the month with 10 wins, the first time since November that they won 10 or more in a month.</s>
<s id="14810">However, the clock had stopped just as the play began.</s>

<s id="15763">Throughout the years of World War II, the camps of Mauthausen-Gusen received new prisoners in smaller transports on a daily basis; mostly from other concentration camps in German-occupied Europe.</s>
<s id="15764">The first transports from Auschwitz arrived in February 1942.</s>
<s id="15765">The second transport in June of that year was much larger and numbered some 1,200 prisoners.</s>
<s id="15766">Finally, after Adolf Eichmann visited Mauthausen in May of that year, KZ Mauthausen-Gusen received the first group of roughly 8,000 Hungarian Jews from Auschwitz; the first group to be evacuated from that camp before the Soviet advance.</s>
<s id="15767">Over time, Auschwitz had to almost stop accepting new prisoners and most were directed to Mauthausen instead.</s>
<s id="15768">Among them was a large group of civilians arrested by the Germans after the failure of the Warsaw Uprising, but by the liberation not more than 500 of them were still alive.</s>
<s id="15769">Altogether, during the final months of the war, 23,364 prisoners from other concentration camps arrived at the camp complex.</s>
<s id="15770">Many of those who survived the journey died before they could be registered, whilst others were given the camp numbers of prisoners who had already been killed.</s>
<s id="15771">The available Mauthausen inmate statistics from the spring of 1943, shows that there were 2,400 prisoners below the age of 20, which was 12.8% of the 18,655 population.</s>
<s id="15772">By late March 1945, the number of juvenile prisoners in Mauthausen increased to 15,048, which was 19.1% of the 78,547 Mauthausen inmates.</s>
<s id="15773">The number of imprisoned children increased 6.2 times, whereas the total number of adult prisoners during the same period multiplied by a factor of only four.</s>
<s id="15774">Statistics showing the composition of juvenile inmates shortly before their liberation reveal the following major child/prisoner sub-groups: 5,809 foreign civilian labourers, 5,055 political prisoners, 3,654 Jews, and 330 Russian POWs.</s>
<s id="15775">The conditions within the camp were considered exceptionally hard to bear, even by concentration camp standards.</s>
<s id="15776">As there were too many prisoners in Mauthausen to have all of them work in its quarry at the same time, many were put to work in workshops, or had to do other manual work, whilst the unfortunate ones who were selected to work in the quarry were only there because of their so-called "crimes" in the camp.</s>
<s id="15777">The work in the quarries – often in unbearable heat or in temperatures as low as – led to exceptionally high mortality rates.</s>
<s id="15778">The food rations were limited, and during the 1940–1942 period, an average inmate weighed .</s>
<s id="15779">It is estimated that the average energy content of food rations dropped from about a day during the 1940–1942 period, to between a day during the next period.</s>
<s id="15780">In 1945 the energy content was even lower and did not exceed a day – less than a third of the energy needed by an average worker in heavy industry.</s>
<s id="15781">This led to the starvation of thousands of inmates.</s>
<s id="15782">Thus the "hospital camp" – as it was called by the German authorities – was, in fact, the last stop before death for thousands of inmates, and very few had a chance to recover.</s>
<s id="15783">The rock-quarry in Mauthausen was at the base of the infamous "Stairs of Death".</s>
<s id="15784">As a result, many exhausted prisoners collapsed in front of the other prisoners in the line, and then fell on top of the other prisoners, creating a horrific domino effect; the first prisoner falling onto the next, and so on, all the way down the stairs.</s>
<s id="15785">Such brutality was not accidental.</s>
<s id="15786">The SS guards would often force prisoners – exhausted from hours of hard labour without sufficient food and water – to race up the stairs carrying blocks of stone.</s>
<s id="15787">At gun-point each prisoner would have the option of being shot or pushing the prisoner in front of him off the cliff.</s>
<s id="15788">While the prisoners were still beaten on a daily basis and the Muselmänner were still exterminated, from early 1943 on some of the factory workers were allowed to receive food parcels from their families (mostly Poles and Frenchmen).</s>
<s id="15789">This allowed many of them not only to evade the risk of starvation, but also to help other prisoners who had no relatives outside the camps – or who were not allowed to receive parcels.</s>
<s id="15790">Also, several thousands were killed in mobile gas chambers, without any mention of the exact number of victims in the remaining files.</s>
<s id="15791">The surviving camp archives include personal files of 37,411 murdered prisoners, including 22,092 Poles, 5,024 Spaniards, 2,843 Soviet prisoners of war and 7,452 inmates of 24 other nationalities.</s>

<s id="15795">Various historians place the total death toll in the four main camps of Mauthausen, Gusen I, Gusen II and Gusen III at between 55,000 and 60,000.</s>
<s id="15796">In addition, during the first month after the liberation additional 1042 prisoners died in American field hospitals.</s>
<s id="15797">Out of approximately 320,000 prisoners who were incarcerated in various sub-camps of KZ Mauthausen-Gusen throughout the war, only approximately 80,000 survived, including between 20,487 and 21,386 in Gusen I, II and III.</s>

<s id="15800">After that, between 1946 and 1947, the camps were unguarded and many furnishings and facilities of the camp were dismantled, both by the Red Army and by the local population.</s>

<s id="16484">Astronomers will sometimes refer to this stage as "zero age main sequence", or ZAMS.</s>

<s id="16490">Thus there is a steady increase in the luminosity and radius of the star over time.</s>

<s id="16492">Main-sequence stars in this region experience only small changes in magnitude and so this variation is difficult to detect.</s>
<s id="16493">== Lifetime ==The total amount of energy that a star can generate through nuclear fusion of hydrogen is limited by the amount of hydrogen fuel that can be consumed at the core.</s>
<s id="16494">For a star in equilibrium, the energy generated at the core must be at least equal to the energy radiated at the surface.</s>
<s id="16495">The energy output of the helium fusion process per unit mass is only about a tenth the energy output of the hydrogen process, and the luminosity of the star increases.</s>
<s id="16496">For very low mass stars, molecules in the atmosphere also contribute to the opacity.</s>
<s id="16497">Below about 0.5 , the luminosity of the star varies as the mass to the power of 2.3, producing a flattening of the slope on a graph of mass versus luminosity.</s>
<s id="16498">In consequence of this change, the outer envelope of the star expands and decreases in temperature, turning it into a red giant.</s>

<s id="17840">The field of science which studies subatomic particles is particle physics, and it is in this field that physicists hope to discover the true fundamental nature of matter.</s>
<s id="17841">The first was the law of conservation of mass, formulated by Antoine Lavoisier in 1789, which states that the total mass in a chemical reaction remains constant (that is, the reactants have the same mass as the products).</s>

<s id="17843">John Dalton studied and expanded upon this previous work and developed the law of multiple proportions: if two elements can be combined to form a number of possible compounds, then the ratios of the masses of the second element which combine with a fixed mass of the first element will be ratios of small whole numbers.</s>

<s id="17848">He also mistakenly believed that the simplest compound between any two elements is always one atom of each (so he thought water was HO, not H2O).</s>
<s id="17849">For instance, in 1803 he believed that oxygen atoms were 5.5 times heavier than hydrogen atoms, because in water he measured 5.5 grams of oxygen for every 1 gram of hydrogen and believed the formula for water was HO.</s>
<s id="17850">Avogadro had proposed that equal volumes of any two gases, at equal temperature and pressure, contain equal numbers of molecules (in other words, the mass of a gas's particles does not affect the volume that it occupies).</s>
<s id="17851">For instance: since two liters of hydrogen will react with just one liter of oxygen to produce two liters of water vapor (at constant pressure and temperature), it meant a single oxygen molecule splits in two in order to form two particles of water.</s>
<s id="17852">Thus, Avogadro was able to offer more accurate estimates of the atomic mass of oxygen and various other elements, and made a clear distinction between molecules and atoms.</s>

<s id="26991">It is a requirement of ICD-10 that a diagnosis of any specific personality disorder also satisfies a set of general personality disorder criteria.</s>
<s id="26992">"Of particular significance is the correlation between the narcissistic disorder and the schizoid.</s>
<s id="26993">This same person may yet be highly aware of any forms of corruption or exploitation outside of this relationship.</s>
<s id="26994">In this approach diagnosis is based on the dynamic of this split and its consequences, as opposed to diagnosis on the basis of a list of external behaviors.</s>
<s id="26995">It is a natural human response to turn away from sources of danger and toward sources of safety.</s>
<s id="26996">====Withdrawnness====Withdrawnness means detachment from the outer world, the other side of introversion.</s>
<s id="26997">The question, however, is whether the intense inner life of the schizoid is due to a desire for hungry incorporation of external objects or due to withdrawal from the outer to a presumed safer inner world.</s>
<s id="26998">Because the schizoid's love objects are internal, he or she finds safety without connecting and attaching to objects in the real world.</s>
<s id="26999">" The more that schizoids can rely on themselves, the less they have to rely on other people and expose themselves to the potential dangers and anxieties associated with that reliance or, even worse, dependence.</s>
<s id="27000">The vast majority of schizoid individuals show an enormous capacity for self-sufficiency and the ability to operate alone, independently and autonomously, in managing their worlds.</s>
<s id="27001">"One has no need of other people, they can be dispensed with...</s>
<s id="27002">There often goes with it a feeling of being different from other people.</s>
<s id="27003">" The sense of superiority of the schizoid has nothing to do with the grandiose self of the narcissistic disorder.</s>
<s id="27004">It does not find expression in the schizoid through the need to devalue or annihilate others who are perceived as offending, criticizing, shaming, or humiliating.</s>
<s id="27005">This type of superiority was described by a young schizoid man::"If I am superior to others, if I am above others, then I do not need others.</s>
<s id="27006">When I say that I am above others, it does not mean that I feel better than them, it means that I am at a distance from them, a safe distance.</s>
<s id="27007">The subjective experience is one of loss of affect.</s>
<s id="27008">This loss of affect is more frequently manifest within the patient as genuine confusion, a sense of something missing in his or her emotional life.</s>
<s id="27009">" This is a central experience of the schizoid that is often lost to the observer.</s>

<s id="27013">Fantasy is also a relationship with the world and with others by proxy.</s>
<s id="27014">It is an expression of the self in exile because it is self-contained and free from the dangers and anxieties associated with emotional connection to real persons and situations.</s>
<s id="27015">Klein explains it as "an expression of the self struggling to connect to objects, albeit internal objects.</s>
<s id="27016">In short, in fantasy one can be attached (to internal objects) and still be free.</s>

<s id="27020">Before it, no psychotropic medication reduced the negative symptoms.</s>
<s id="27021">The perception of varied events only increases their fear for intimacy and limits them in their interpersonal relationships.</s>
<s id="27022">This can help people with SPD create empathy with the outside world.</s>
<s id="27023">To create a more adaptive and self-enriching interaction with others in which one "feels real," the patient is encouraged to take risks through greater connection, communication, and sharing of ideas, feelings, and actions.</s>
<s id="27024">The limiting factor is the point at which the dangers of intimacy become overwhelming and the patient must again retreat.</s>
<s id="27025">Its goals are to change fundamentally the old ways of feeling and thinking, and to rid oneself of the vulnerability to those emotions associated with old feelings and thoughts.</s>
<s id="27026">If the goal of shorter-term therapy is for patients to understand that they are not the way they appear to be and can act differently, then the longer-term goal of working through is for patients to understand who and what they are as human beings, what they truly are like and what they truly contain.</s>
<s id="27027">The goal of working through is not achieved by the patient’s sudden discovery of a hidden, fully formed talented and creative self living inside, but is a process of slowly freeing oneself from the confinement of abandonment depression in order to uncover a potential.</s>
<s id="27028">It is a process of experimentation with the spontaneous, nonreactive elements that can be experienced in relationship with others.</s>
<s id="27029">Working through abandonment depression is a complicated, lengthy and conflicted process that can be an enormously painful experience in terms of what is remembered and what must be felt.</s>
<s id="27030">It involves mourning and grieving for the loss of the illusion that the patient had adequate support for the emergence of the real self.</s>
<s id="27031">"Only schizoid patients", suggests Klein, "who have worked through the abandonment depression ... ultimately will believe that the capacity for relatedness and the wish for relatedness are woven into the structure of their beings, that they are truly part of who the patients are and what they contain as human beings.</s>
<s id="27032">It is this sense that finally allows the schizoid patient to feel the most intimate sense of being connected with humanity more generally, and with another person more personally.</s>
<s id="27033">For the schizoid patient, this degree of certainty is the most gratifying revelation, and a profound new organizer of the self experience.</s>

<s id="27956">A person with narcolepsy is likely to become drowsy or fall asleep, often at inappropriate times and places, or just be very tired throughout the day.</s>
<s id="27957">Narcoleptics are not able to experience the amount of restorative deep sleep that healthy people experience – they are not "over-sleeping".</s>
<s id="27958">In fact, narcoleptics live their entire lives in a constant state of extreme sleep deprivation.</s>
<s id="27959">It is estimated that up to 40 percent of people with narcolepsy experience automatic behavior during sleep episodes.</s>
<s id="27960">The other symptoms may begin alone or in combination months or years after the onset of the daytime naps.</s>
<s id="27961">Only about 20 to 25 percent of people with narcolepsy experience all four symptoms.</s>
<s id="27962">When a person first falls asleep, the brain waves become slower and less regular.</s>
<s id="27963">After about an hour and a half of NREM sleep, the brain waves begin to show a more active pattern again.</s>
<s id="27964">In narcolepsy, the order and length of NREM and REM sleep periods are disturbed, with REM sleep occurring at sleep onset instead of after a period of NREM sleep.</s>
<s id="27965">Thus, narcolepsy is a disorder in which REM sleep appears at an abnormal time.</s>
<s id="27966">Night time sleep does not include as much deep sleep, so the brain tries to "catch up" during the day, hence EDS.</s>
<s id="27967">There appeared to be a correlation between individuals with narcolepsy and certain variations in HLA genes, although it was not required for the condition to occur.</s>
<s id="27968">The protein produced, called hypocretin or orexin, is responsible for controlling appetite and sleep patterns.</s>
<s id="27969">In 2009 the autoimmune hypothesis was supported by research carried out at Stanford University School of Medicine.</s>
<s id="27970">Narcolepsy is strongly associated with HLA-DQB1*0602 genotype.</s>
<s id="27971">There is also an association with HLA-DR2 and HLA-DQ1.</s>
<s id="27972">In Finland in mid-November 2010, 37 cases of children's narcolepsy had been reported by doctors.</s>
<s id="27973">This can be compared to the normal average of 3 cases of children's narcolepsy per year.</s>
<s id="27974">"The incidence of narcolepsy with cataplexy in children/adolescents in the Swedish population increased during the pandemic and vaccination period, with a rapid decline in incidence during the post pandemic period.</s>
<s id="27975">" Their conclusion is that these results "provide strengthened evidence that vaccination with Pandemrix during the pandemic period could be associated with an increase in the risk for narcolepsy with cataplexy in predisposed children/adolescents 19 years and younger.</s>
<s id="27976">==Diagnosis==Diagnosis is relatively easy when all the symptoms of narcolepsy are present, but if the sleep attacks are isolated and cataplexy is mild or absent, diagnosis is more difficult.</s>
<s id="27977">Three tests that are commonly used in diagnosing narcolepsy are the polysomnogram, the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), and administration of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale.</s>
<s id="27978">These tests are usually performed by a sleep specialist.</s>
<s id="27979">The polysomnogram involves continuous recording of sleep brain waves and a number of nerve and muscle functions during nighttime sleep.</s>
<s id="27980">The polysomnogram also helps to detect other possible sleep disorders that could cause daytime sleepiness.</s>
<s id="27981">The Epworth Sleepiness Scale is a brief questionnaire that is administered to determine the likelihood of the presence of a sleep disorder, including narcolepsy.</s>
<s id="27982">For the multiple sleep latency test, a person is given a chance to sleep every 2 hours during normal wake times.</s>
<s id="27983">Occasionally, a multiple sleep latency test can result in a false-negative for a narcoleptic.</s>
<s id="27984">This test can be useful when MSLT results are inconclusive or difficult to interpret.</s>
<s id="27985">Treatment is tailored to the individual, based on symptoms and therapeutic response.</s>
<s id="27986">The time required to achieve optimal control of symptoms is highly variable, and may take several months or longer.</s>
<s id="27987">While oral medications are the mainstay of formal narcolepsy treatment, lifestyle changes are also important.</s>
<s id="27988">The main treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness in narcolepsy is central nervous system stimulants such as methylphenidate, amphetamine, methamphetamine, modafinil (Provigil), a new stimulant with a different pharmacologic mechanism, and/or armodafinil (Nuvigil).</s>
<s id="27989">Other medications used are codeine and selegiline.</s>
<s id="27990">In many cases, planned regular short naps can reduce the need for pharmacological treatment of the EDS but only improve symptoms for a short duration.</s>
<s id="27991">Ongoing communication between the health care provider, patient, and the patient's family members is important for optimal management of narcolepsy.</s>
<s id="27992">==Epidemiology==In the United States, it is estimated that this condition afflicts as many as 200,000 Americans, but fewer than 50,000 are diagnosed.</s>
<s id="27993">There is strong evidence that narcolepsy may run in families; around 10 percent of people diagnosed with narcolepsy with cataplexy have a close relative with this neurological disorder.</s>
<s id="27994">===GABA-directed medications===Given the possible role of hyper-active GABAA receptors in the primary hypersomnias (narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia), medications that could counteract this activity are being studied to test their potential to improve sleepiness.</s>
<s id="27995">These currently include clarithromycin and flumazenil.</s>
<s id="27996">====Flumazenil====Flumazenil is the only GABAA receptor antagonist on the market as of Jan 2013, and it is currently manufactured only as an intravenous formulation.</s>
<s id="27997">For one patient, daily administration of flumazenil by sublingual lozenge and topical cream has proven effective for several years.</s>
<s id="27998">====Clarithromycin====In a test tube model, clarithromycin (an antibiotic approved by the FDA for the treatment of infections) was found to return the function of the GABA system to normal in patients with primary hypersomnias.</s>
<s id="27999">Therefore, companies are currently developing hypocretin receptor antagonists, like almorexant, which is awaiting FDA approval for the treatment of insomnia.</s>
<s id="28000">The key figure here was Colonel Hans Oster, head of the Military Intelligence Office from 1938, and an anti-Nazi from as early as 1934.</s>

<s id="28002">Remarkably, the army commander, General Walther von Brauchitsch, was well aware of the coup preparations.</s>
<s id="28003">But although Britain and France were now prepared to go to war over Poland, as war approached Halder lost his nerve.</s>
<s id="28004">When in November 1939 it seemed that Hitler was about to order an immediate attack in the west, the conspirators persuaded General Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb, commander of Army Group C on the Belgian border, to support a planned coup if Hitler gave such an order.</s>
<s id="28005">But when Hitler postponed the attack until 1940, the conspiracy again lost momentum, and Halder formed the view that the German people would not accept a coup.</s>
<s id="28006">This explains the vacillations of Halder, who could never quite bring himself to take the decisive step.</s>
<s id="28007">Halder hated Hitler, and believed that the Nazis were leading Germany to catastrophe.</s>

<s id="28010">They passed what they had learned to foreign countries, through personal contacts with the U.S. embassy and, via a less direct connection, to the Soviet government.</s>
<s id="28011">The group was betrayed to the Gestapo in August 1942 by Johann Wenzel, a member of the Trepper group who also knew of the Schulze-Boysen group and who informed on them after being arrested.</s>
<s id="28012">Until 1941 the group operated a study circle, but after the German attack on the Soviet Union a core group advanced to active resistance.</s>
<s id="28013">In March 1943 two of them, Oster and Hans von Dohnanyi, were dismissed on suspicion of opposition activity, although there was yet insufficient evidence to have them arrested.</s>
<s id="28014">But beneath the surface of German society there were also currents of resistance, if not always consciously political.</s>
<s id="28015">Another form of resistance was assisting the persecuted German Jews.</s>

<s id="28052">This is particularly true in the armed forces of the United States, where gun-howitzers have been officially described as "howitzers" for more than sixty years.</s>
<s id="28053">In the middle of the 18th century a number of European armies began to introduce howitzers that were mobile enough to accompany armies in the field.</s>
<s id="28054">In 1859 the armies of Europe (including those that had recently adopted gun-howitzers) began to rearm field batteries with rifled field guns.</s>
<s id="28055">At first this was largely a matter of the same basic weapon being employed on two different mountings.</s>
<s id="28056">The standard German light field howitzer at the start of the war (the 10.5 cm leichte Feldhaubitze 98/09) had a barrel that was 16 calibers long, but the light field howitzer adopted by the German Army in 1916 (105 mm leichte Feldhaubitze 16, see on the left) had a barrel that was 22 calibers long.</s>
<s id="28057">In the US Army, however, the preferred term was "howitzer".</s>
<s id="28058">Thus, as gun-howitzers replaced both guns and howitzers, words such as "obusier" (French) and "Haubitze" (German), which had originally been used to designate weapons with relatively short barrels, were applied to weapons with much longer barrels.</s>

<s id="29084">Supernova nucleosynthesis within exploding stars by fusing carbon and oxygen is responsible for the abundances of elements between magnesium (atomic number 12) and nickel (atomic number 28).</s>
<s id="29085">The synthesis of these heavier elements absorbs energy (endothermic) as they are created, from the energy produced during the supernova explosion.</s>
<s id="29086">A few minutes afterward, starting with only protons and neutrons, nuclei up to lithium and beryllium (both with mass number 7) were formed, but the abundances of other elements dropped sharply with growing atomic mass.</s>
<s id="29087">Some boron may have been formed at this time, but the process stopped before significant carbon could be formed, as this element requires a far higher product of helium density and time than were present in the short nucleosynthesis period of the Big Bang.</s>

<s id="29092">In the years immediately before World War II, Hans Bethe first elucidated those nuclear mechanisms by which hydrogen is fused into helium.</s>
<s id="29093">The Big Bang itself had been proposed in 1931, long before this period, by Georges Lemaître, a Belgian physicist and Roman Catholic priest, who suggested that the evident expansion of the Universe in time required that the Universe, if contracted backwards in time, would continue to do so until it could contract no further.</s>
<s id="29094">This would bring all the mass of the Universe to a single point, a "primeval atom", to a state before which time and space did not exist.</s>
<s id="29095">The goal of the theory of nucleosynthesis is to explain the vastly differing abundances of the chemical elements and their several isotopes from the perspective of natural processes.</s>
<s id="29096">Those abundances, when plotted on a graph as a function of atomic number, have a jagged sawtooth structure that varies by factors up to ten million.</s>
<s id="29097">See "Handbook of Isotopes in the Cosmos" for more data and discussion of abundances of the isotopes.</s>
<s id="29098">The majority of these occur in shells within stars, and the chain of those nuclear fusion processes are known as hydrogen burning (via the proton-proton chain or the CNO cycle), helium burning, carbon burning, neon burning, oxygen burning and silicon burning.</s>
<s id="29099">These processes are able to create elements up to and including iron and nickel.</s>
<s id="29100">Heavier elements can be assembled within stars by a neutron capture process known as the s-process or in explosive environments, such as supernovae, by a number of other processes.</s>
<s id="29101">Some of those others include the r-process, which involves rapid neutron captures, the rp-process, and the p-process (sometimes known as the gamma process), which results in the photodisintegration of existing nuclei.</s>
<s id="29102">== The major types of nucleosynthesis =====Big Bang nucleosynthesis===Big Bang nucleosynthesis occurred within the first three minutes of the beginning of the universe and is responsible for much of the abundance of 1H (protium), 2H (D, deuterium), 3He (helium-3), and 4He (helium-4).</s>
<s id="29103">Because of the very short period in which nucleosynthesis occurred before it was stopped by expansion and cooling (about 20 minutes), no elements heavier than beryllium (or possibly boron) could be formed.</s>
<s id="29104">Elements formed during this time were in the plasma state, and did not cool to the state of neutral atoms until much later.</s>
<s id="29105">Of particular importance is carbon, because its formation from He is a bottleneck in the entire process.</s>
<s id="29106">Carbon is produced by the triple-alpha process in all stars.</s>
<s id="29107">The first direct proof that nucleosynthesis occurs in stars was the astronomical observation that interstellar gas has become enriched with heavy elements as time passed.</s>
<s id="29108">As a result, stars that were born from it late in the galaxy, formed with much higher initial heavy element abundances than those that had formed earlier.</s>
<s id="29109">The detection of technetium in the atmosphere of a red giant star in 1952, by spectroscopy, provided the first evidence of nuclear activity within stars.</s>
<s id="29110">The r-process is responsible for our natural cohort of radioactive elements, such as uranium and thorium, as well as the most neutron-rich isotopes of each heavy element.</s>
<s id="29111">During this process, the burning of oxygen and silicon fuses nuclei that themselves have equal numbers of protons and neutrons to produce nuclides which consist of whole numbers of helium nuclei, up to 15 (representing 60Ni).</s>
<s id="29112">The quasiequilibrium produces radioactive isobars 44Ti, 48Cr, 52Fe, and 56Ni, which (except 44Ti) are created in abundance but decay after the explosion and leave the most stable isotope of the corresponding element at the same atomic weight.</s>
<s id="29113">The most abundant and extant isotopes of elements produced in this way are 48Ti, 52Cr, and 56Fe.</s>
<s id="29114">The detection of these emission lines were an important early product of gamma-ray astronomy.</s>
<s id="29115">===Cosmic ray spallation===Cosmic ray spallation process reduces the atomic weight of interstellar matter by the impact with cosmic rays, to produce some of the lightest elements present in the universe (though not a significant amount of deuterium).</s>
